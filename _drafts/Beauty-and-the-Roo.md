Oh goodness our two degus couldn't be more different. Pip is a handsome little fellow, who takes grooming and bathing very seriously. While out he loves fuss from us and likes to groom us back. He climbs on us and chatters and is full off fun and bounciness.

Now, Roo on the other hand is Pip's complete opposite. He does not like to be touched, and if he had his way I don't think he'd leave his cage at all. Personal hygiene is not something that interests Roo, he is a scruffy little ball of grease and he seems to like it that way. As far as we can tell there is nothing wrong with him, he's active, has a healthy appetite and sleeps very soundly, but he is a mess.

Both boys have these huge metal wheels in their homes and Roo plays in his endlessly and bounces around his cage like he's having a wonderful time. However when it comes to play time with us, Roo is not so keen. We know he loves us and he's not scared, if we approach his cage he'll come to us and chirp his happy songs, but coming out is not something Roo is very interested in, which is a problem.

Neither of the degus have a dust bath in their cage, instead when have one in a cat loo, to contain the dust, that they can use when they come out to play. Pip is very happy with this arrangement and uses the bath as little or as much as he fancies. We are very consistent with playtimes, so the boys know when we'll be there and they'll get access to the bath. Not that Roo cares.

Unlike Pip, Roo stubbornly refuses to take a bath, at all!! We like to give our boys a little treat at the end of playtime to reward them for being good and putting themselves away when ready. This works fine with Pip, but given half a chance Roo would hop out of his cage and straight back in expecting his treats!

Derek and I are not as daft as Roo thinks and we saw his little game, and we also saw this meant he wasn't getting a bath at playtime either. So not being unreasonable, because we know how active he is in his cage, we taught him to have to have a dust bath before he got his treats. This was very simple to do, Roo is a smart little fellow and simply pointing to the bath let him know what we wanted. He obliged, at first.

We noticed that Roo's baths were getting shorter and shorter, until he was doing nothing more than jumping in, barely having on quick roll and then coming back trailing dust everywhere. He'd jump on Derek's knee expecting his treats and cover him in dust too. It was funny, but Roo's fur wasn't looking too good, so we had to tell him off. 

Now Roo has to have two baths, even very short ones, before he gets any treats. His fur is looking a lot better for our new regime, not that Roo appreciates it. We're not mean, Roo can go in at any point, but he won't get treats until he's had those two baths.

Our Roo can be a cheeky little fellow when he wants and he'll often try to bend the rules. Sometimes he'll have a bath and then run around the room, before turning up for his treats like we'll not notice he didn't bathe. Other times he'll jump in the bath for a second time and not actually roll around. He also likes to try and intimidate us, jumping on Derek, who gives him the treats, and being very insistent. We sit on the floor with both boys and we quite like Roo when climbs on us, but we don't tell him that. Oh he's such a silly guy, but we do love him, both of them.
