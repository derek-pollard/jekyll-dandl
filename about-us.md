### Lindsay:

I'm aÂ graphic designer and both Derek and I work from home, which is great as it means we get to spend lots of time with everyone, including each other. Other than website design, and the critters my other hobbies include cross-stitch, drawing, riding my bicycle and being outdoors.

I love living near the coast and Felixstowe is just down the road from us. Derek and I are both originally from Nottingham, and we moved here to Suffolk many years ago with Derek's job, and fell in love with the place. The best bit about being so close to the seaside is wrapping up warm on a cold and windy day and walking along the deserted seafront. You never know what the tide has washed in; sometimes its nothing and others there are beautiful shells and pebbles to find.

  Unbelievably i first started this website back in 2001. The Internet and websites weren't quite what we know today, but a few amazing pets sites inspired me and so our critters went online. Since the site started it has been redesigned a few times, the biggest change was converting it to a WordPress site, which it still is. The current design was implemented at the end of 2014, while Derek and I were enjoying our Christmas break, with the help of our fuzzy family that is.

Unbelievably I first started this website back in 2001. The Internet and websites weren't quite what we know today, but a few amazing pets sites inspired me and so our critters went online. Since the site started it has been redesigned a few times, the biggest change was converting the whole site to WordPress back in 2011.

When Lindsay started this website, it was very much her project, but over the years I became interested in website design, and gave up work as a computer software developer to start a website design business with Lindsay. After creating a new template for the Derek and Lindsay website I started to feel more part of it. So, now you will find contributions from me, usually under the Out and About section, I'll leave writing about the animals to Lindsay.

    Like Lindsay I enjoy cycling and being outside, and my other interests include video games and photography. I take pretty much all the photographs you see here on the site.

    I'm really proud of what Lindsay started here with Derek and Lindsay. It is amazing to look back on all the adventures and memories of our pets and I'm looking forward to adding to the stories with Lindsay.
