Both of us had kept gerbils as teenagers long before we met, so it seemed like fate that we should have gerbils again. Anyone who has had gerbils will know what great fun they are. For such small animals they love human interaction, whether you are feeding them sunflowers or just a giant climbing frame. We have never known a gerbil who doesn't thrive on attention, some may not be easy to keep hold of, but it doesn't mean they don't like you.
