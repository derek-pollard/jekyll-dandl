Treacle and Custard are brothers and were six months old when we adopted them from our local branch of The Blue Cross. It was the 13th December 1997, the last day before they closed for Christmas. It was upsetting seeing the cats of all ages looking for homes and Lindsay wanted to leave, she couldn't choose. Derek knew better, a little silver tabby had already picked him. Every time Derek went near the pen the little cat would rub up against the bars purring, it was Treacle. Derek was sold :-), we weren't leaving alone. There were four other cats in the pen with Treacle, as we wanted to offer a home to two cats we had the difficult job of picking another one. Our first choice was not actually Custard, the cat we chose would not come out from behind the cat loo! Custard was peering innocently out of the cat bed, so the poor little chap was grabbed and stuck in the cat box beside Treacle.

Treacle and Custard are very sweet little chaps, if a little demanding at times. Both of them insist on harassing us until they are picked up, they do enjoy being carried around. Luckily Treacle and Custard leave our other little animal friends alone, preferring to sleep rather than pay attention to the antics of the rest of the family.
