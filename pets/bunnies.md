  - 'Derek is responsible for our collection of dwarf rabbits, both past and present. Bunnies in the garden and bunnies in the house, "Too many bunnies", as I often exclaim when everyone is demanding bunny treats.  Despite my protests, each of our little rabbits will always hold a very special place in our hearts.'
