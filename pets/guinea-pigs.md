Coco and Clipper came to live with us in 1996. I had always been fascinated by the little squeaky things she had seen shuffling around in the hay at pet shops.

Coco and Clipper spent their days out in the garden munching on grass and anything else we could find to give them. They'd shuffle around their run muttering to themselves occasionally giving an ear piercing squeak, goodness knows what the neighbours thought!

As with our bunnies, Coco & Clipper came in at night to keep them warm and safe. At night the bossy little chaps liked to whistle and squeak when they thought it was time to be fed, we had to oblige if we wanted any peace. Their favourite bed time treat was Curly Kale, the smell of it sent them into a squeaking frenzy. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Coco and Clippers nighttime cage (left) and outdoor home" class="size-full wp-image-6592" title="Our guinea pigs indoor and outdoor homes" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_homes.jpg" alt="Coco and Clippers nighttime cage (left) and outdoor home" height="357" %}
