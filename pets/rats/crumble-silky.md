## Two sweet boys

It was a very hot June day and we popped into the pet shop for a little look. Crumble was all alone, hot and very cute, so in a box he went and home he came! {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Baby Crumble following out big old boys, Dusty & Smarty" class="size-full wp-image-6890" title="Our baby rat Crumble, with two fully grown boys Dusty & Smarty" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_sc0078.jpg" alt="Baby Crumble following out big old boys, Dusty & Smarty" height="307" %} 

We already had two rats, Dusty and Smarty but they were old chaps and were not interested in the new arrival. So off we went on a trip to find Crumble a friend (does it ever end?) Crumble was living up to his name with his patchy fur and wrinkly skin, so it was only fitting that his sleek new companion should be called Silky. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Partners in crime" class="size-full wp-image-6893" title="Two rats, Crumble & Silky wandering around on our sofa" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_sc0103.jpg" alt="Partners in crime" height="374" %} 

We found Silky all alone in a pet shop, he looked a bit lonely and not very interested in us. Silky got very upset on the journey home and we were worried about him, with all the stress of a new home and friend. We needn't have worried it was love at first sight, Crumble had a new friend and Silky was just glad to be away from the noisy pet shop. The mismatched pair became inseparable, from the first day they were always huddled up somewhere together. Silky spent what seemed like hours grooming Crumble, but it never worked.

After two years of happiness together, Silky died we were very worried about how Crumble would adjust to being on his own. As Lindsay is lucky enough to be a stay home rattie mum, Crumble turned into a cuddly mummy's boy. He enjoyed all the extra attention of being our only rat, spending most of his time asleep in Lindsay's clothes.
