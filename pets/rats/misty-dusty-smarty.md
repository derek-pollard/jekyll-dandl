## Our trio of trouble {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Misty" class="size-full wp-image-5968" title="Misty, our ginger hooded rat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_sc0040.jpg" alt="Misty" height="186" %} 

Misty was our second little rattie friend, we hadn't really planned to get anymore rats but you do miss them. Misty was the most beautiful rat we had ever seen. He wasn't a tiny baby and he was all alone in the pet shop, how could we resist?

We wanted a friend for Misty but all we could find were tiny babies. So rather than get another lone rat and risk them not getting on, we got a pair (good thinking). Dusty and Smarty were the only boys out of a litter of ten. They were very tiny when we got them and Misty was not impressed. Misty was big and cuddly and the new arrivals were small and never stopped, believe me they drove me mad. Who knows what poor Misty thought of them.

Misty was having none of it putting up with the little horrors at play time was one thing, but to live with them. A compromise was reached. Misty had his home, Dusty & Smarty had theirs right next door. Misty was allowed into Dusty & Smarty's home, to eat their food etc, but no one was allowed into Misty's home.

The trio played together happily most of the time. Smarty was a trouble causer he would chase Misty around jumping on his tail. Misty would only take so much of this abuse. Smarty would always manage to run away, but poor Dusty would be in the wrong place. Misty would role the harmless little chap onto his back, making him squeak for help. I think Misty liked their company really though, he never hurt either of them.
