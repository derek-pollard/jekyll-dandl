## Our first girl rats

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6902" title="Our two new baby rats, Pipsie & Chockie" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/page_dscf1155.jpg" alt="Our two new baby rats, Pipsie & Chockie" width="390" height="262" /> Pipsie and Chockie were our first girl rats. We had always had little boy rats before, so we thought it would be fun to have a pair of girls. We had read about how girls were more active than boys, little did we know.

Pipsie and Chockie were tiny when we got them. They had just arrived at the pet shop as we turned up. At first we just thought they were over excitable being such tiny babies in a new home, but no. We soon realised that the homes our little boy rats had been happy living in were not big enough. A trip down the pet shop and we returned with a parrot cage that only just fitted in our car!

Derek made some Perspex shelves to add to the parrot ladders, ferret tubes, hammock and anything else we could lay our hands on to make their home interesting. The two little horrors liked it, though it is a big job cleaning it every week.

Pipsie and Chockie's cage used to be in the living room, but two rats chewing the bars and clambering for attention while your trying to have a quiet sit down is not relaxing. So we moved the noisy little pair into the dinning room. Meal times have never been the same since.
