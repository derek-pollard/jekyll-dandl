## Badger's entry:

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1314" title="Badger enjoying some slurpy food" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/1272_img.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="285" /> Oh yummy, dad is on this new healthy eating thing and it is so yummy. He takes some yoghurt and adds bananas puts them all in a blender and mushes them up, mushy is always good. He eats it with me and always shares, oh yummy it is so good. And because it is healthy I can eat as much as I want and don't get told off.<!--more-->

I am in heaven, we don't have it every night I guess dad doesn't want to be that healthy. It is like eating fruit but without having to chew, I can just slurp it up.

Oh I am so happy when I'm slurping.
