  September 2003
</h1>

With the sad loss of our amazing little rattie Willow, Biscuit and Badger were too upset to write their diary entries. So they have picked out some of their favourite Willow photos and memories to share.<!--more-->

## Badger says:

Willow joined our family as a baby, mum and dad didn't know how old he was mum just found him in the woods! He often told me amazing stories of life in the wild and how he was kept for a whole week in quarantine in case he had any scary illnesses. I got very excited when mum told me I was getting a new brother. I knew he wouldn't be as cute as me, but I was going to love him anyway. Family is very important to us ratties.

## Biscuit says:

I wasn't convinced about sharing my cage with anyone else, badger took up enough room, even as a baby. I changed my mind though when mum and dad put us all into this enormous new cage together. It was amazing there were lots of places for me to go and be on my own, Willow kept coming to find me I didn't really mind he was cute, cuddly and didn't wet the bed like Badger.

## Badger says:

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1247" title="Willow & Badger peeking out of a towel" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/5741_img.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="233" /> I really liked having Willow around he was heaps more fun than Biscuit. Even though he was my brother we were best friends. I liked doing everything with Willow, even getting into trouble. I was so cute that mum and dad couldn't stay cross with us for long. Willow thought it was his cheeky smile that won them over, but I know best.

## Biscuit says:

Willow was the same size as me and Badger when he arrived, but while Badger and I grew Willow didn't. He said he wanted to stay small so he could always get into those naughty places mum and dad used to tell us off for getting into. Badger would try and follow him and get his bottom stuck.

I remember how naughty Willow was. He always wanted to go exploring even when it was time to sleep. Sometimes I would go on his adventures with him, it was very exciting. We would climb to really high places and giggle, we never took Biscuit with us because he would complain and be grumpy.

## Biscuit says:

When Willow and Badger used to go off on their adventures they thought they were leaving me out. They didn't realise that they were just distracting mum and dad so I could do whatever I wanted and not get into trouble.

## Badger says:

While Willow and I were off on our adventures we would get hungry and thirsty. Willow would show me the survival techniques he had learned from living in the woods. Drinking from plant saucers was horrible, the water was dirty but Willow didn't seem to mind. He also warned me about being alert for dangerous animals, but all we ever encountered were mum, dad and grumpy Biscuit. There were these strange cat things but we never found them while exploring!

## Biscuit says:

Willow would sometimes bring crunchy leaves back from his expeditions. He would be to excited to eat them so I would find where he hid them, they weren't very nice but it stopped Badger eating them.

<img class="size-full wp-image-1250 aligncenter" title="Willow the brave" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/7498_img.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="169" /> 

## Badger says:

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1252" title="Willow, Biscuit & Badger enjying their dinner" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/7152_img2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="182" /> I really love Willow, sometimes in the night I still go looking for him, just to give him a cuddle. My cute little badger heart aches when I think I won't see him again. Mum and dad give me lots of extra attention but it's just not the same. I would even give up my share of dinner to have him home again. I miss Willow so much, he was my bestist friend ever.

## Biscuit says:

I know Willow was a pest but he used to keep Badger out of my way. And I rather liked it when he would lie on top of me when the nights were cold. Badger was too heavy but Willow was just right for snuggling under and keeping the drafts out. If I had known all his crazy antics and acrobatics would have caused him such serious harm I would have made him take more care. Our home really is just too big without him and life just won't be the same. I try to be more friendly now because mum and dad miss Willow too. I know I'm not as cute and cuddly as him, but it makes me feel better to see mum smile at me.
