Things just aren't the same without Willow, I really miss him. Mum likes it when I run around and do Willow type things like climbing on the furniture and running around, but it's just not as much fun as when Willow was here. I don't understand why he had to leave, we all loved him so much. Our cage seems so big with just Biscuit and me in it and no one fits in the tube that Willow used to sleep in, mum says she is going to get a bigger one so me and Biscuit can use it, it makes her sad to see Willow's tube all empty.<!--more-->

## Biscuit's entry:

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1268" title="Biscuit saying hello" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/8469_img.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="250" /> Mum, dad and Badger all miss Willow and I guess I do too, even though he was a pest. Mum insists on picking me up more now, I try to act like I'm going to bite her but she doesn't care. She says she needs to handle me lots to keep me healthy and strong, I guess I don't mind especially if it helps her feel better. Sometimes it is really hard to remember he's not there, especially at night. I still miss his bouncing around.

## Lindsay's entry:

It's been very difficult helping the little rats with their diary entries this month. We all miss little Willow very much, he was a very gentle little chap. I had big plans for this diary entry to celebrate my little ratties 1st year diary anniversary, but now it is just a reminder of how short a time Willow was here. He will always be in our hearts and a very special member of our family. I hope Willow knows just how much we love him.
