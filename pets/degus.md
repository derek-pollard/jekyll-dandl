  - 'Looking like huge gerbils, degus have fascinated us for quite some time.  With their chattering ways, long lifespan and a love of adventure they are the perfect addition to our family.  Starting with Max, the degu population in our home soon grew and we are loving learning everything about these wonderful critters.'
