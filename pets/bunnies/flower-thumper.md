## Super cute house bunnies

Thumper & Flower were Derek's moment of weakness, we went to stock up on supplies and came home with two bunnies. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="470" caption="Our indoor bunny run" class="size-full wp-image-6645" title="Our dwarf bunnies indoor bunny run" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_3722_IMG.jpg" alt="Our indoor bunny run" height="353" %} 

As Mars & Jupiter already occupied the garden we got to discover the fun of house bunnies. Flower & Thumper have a room upstairs and a large indoor bunny run, with a bunny door so they can easily come out and play. Derek made our bunny run, taking great care to listen to what the bunnies wanted. Thumper insisted on windows so he could keep and eye on what was going on. We used large cardboard boxes as tunnels and as Thumper likes to climb on things Derek made him a platform. With Thumper's love of climbing we also had to fit a lid to the run to stop him jumping out.

Having house bunnies is a great experience. They are a lovely little pair, who entertain us with their antics. Flower is very sweet it is hard to do anything without him coming to help, he enjoys standing on our feet. He's not quite as adventuress as Thumper, and he often gets left out when Thumper goes climbing.

Thumper is much more serious, he will bang his bunny door when it's time to come out. So we don't get the opportunity to be bad bunny parents. Although, Thumper has a very naughty habit of banging his bunny door until we open it and then staying in the run for a sleep. His greatest obsession is getting into our wardrobes, open the door for a second and he will charge at it, the little horror has been shut in before. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Thumper and flower relaxing in the sunshine" class="size-full wp-image-6647" title="Our dwarf bunnies enjoying some sunshine" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_1336_IMG.jpg" alt="Thumper and flower relaxing in the sunshine" height="453" %} 

Having house bunnies is very hard work, their fluff gets everywhere and the vacuum gets a bit clogged up. Flower and Thumper are great fun, it is hard to remember our home without a pair of bunnies scampering around.

Its not been all fun and games though and the hair dryer cable has fallen victim on several occasions to our little bunnies teeth and so have a pair of slippers! They also enjoy the odd nibble at the bed clothes, in fact anything hanging over the edge of the bed is at risk.

## A roof for Thumper

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6651" title="A wire lid for our indoor bunny run" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_3668_IMG.jpg" alt="A wire lid for our indoor bunny run" width="780" height="585" />  {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="'Let me out'" class="size-full wp-image-6652" title="Our dwarf bunny, Thumper testing his new roof with his teeth" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_3751_IMG.jpg" alt="'Let me out'" height="343" %} 

It wasn't long after we got our sweet little boys that we encountered a problem with Thumper - he's an escapologist. When we first designed the indoor bunny run it had no lid, which meant little Thumper could climb onto things and jump out the roof! The worst thing was once outside, without Flower, he was not very impressed and could not get back in. So to contain our very adventurous bunny and keep him safe, we have added a lid to the run.

The new lid has the double advantage of keeping Thumper contained, and keeping our cats out. Not that they have tried to get in the bunny run, or even in their room, but should they ever wander in our bunnies won't find themselves with an uninvited feline roommate.

Despite not actually enjoying himself when he escapes from the run, Thumper is not impressed with the new addition of a roof. He will stand on his bunny ledge and chomp on it for ages. I'm sure he likes the terrible noise it makes, because even if we go to him he doesn't always want to come out!
