## Our first pair of bunnies {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="310" caption="My first bunny, Thumper" class="size-full wp-image-6689" title="My first rabbit, Thumper sitting on my dad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_sc0153.jpg" alt="My first rabbit, Thumper sitting on my dad" height="278" %} 

Derek says he was inspired to get get bunnies because they reminded him of gerbils, just bigger! "It's the way they hop about" he says. After six years of looking after bunnies he has learnt what complex little characters they are.

I'd had a rabbit 'Thumper' when I was little, and I'd told Derek many stories about the trouble he got into. While my Thumper lived in the garden and had a large run he regularly came into the house to eat the furniture.

Our bunnies, Mars and Jupiter, are Netherland Dwarfs, a little easier to handle than a full size bunny. We had wanted a pair of bunnies and thought dwarf rabbits would be more manageable, my Thumper had grown into a very large bunny and the thought of two of him was a bit much! {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Mars & Jupiter as babies" class="size-full wp-image-6690" title="Our two baby dwarf bunnies, Mars and Jupiter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_sc0035_7.jpg" alt="Mars & Jupiter as babies" height="449" %} {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Mars & Jupiter's indoor bunny home" class="size-full wp-image-6691" title="Our dwarf bunnies in their indoor bunny home" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_4008_IMG.jpg" alt="Mars & Jupiter's indoor bunny home" height="293" %} 

It was late September and very chilly when Mars & Jupiter came to live with us. They were so tiny we couldn't bring ourselves to leave them in the garden that night, so their large hutch was brought inside. The next day it was a trip down the pet shop to get them an indoor home, they now come in every night. Mars & Jupiter share a bedroom with our two [house bunnies, Flower & Thumper](/flower-thumper/), and our [guinea pigs, Coco & Clipper](/guinea-pigs/).

As babies Mars & Jupiter were very overwhelmed by the outside world. It took them several days to venture off the patio onto that funny green stuff we call grass. They would run backwards and forwards along the edge of the patio, sniff the grass and then run away from it. Mars was the first to take the plunge soon followed by Jupiter. It's hard to believe now, how nervous of the grass they were.

During the day our little bunnies play outside, they have the run of the garden. I am a stay at home bunny mum, so I am there to keep and eye on them. Derek made our bunny run, as we couldn't find anything suitable in the pet shops. A bunny door was very important to us, so Mars and Jupiter are free to run round the garden. We like to put our bunnies back in their run when we we aren't around to keep an eye on them. Mars and Jupiter are both very good at going back into their run when we need them to. We just have to clap and off they go. Sometimes, usually if they have been sleeping behind a bush and just woken up they can be a bit naughty, but it doesn't happen very often. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Mars & Jupiter's outdoor run" class="size-full wp-image-6692" title="Our homemade out-door bunny run" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/post_3459_IMG.jpg" alt="Mars & Jupiter's outdoor run" height="428" %} 

When the cold weather comes Mars and Jupiter like to spend most of their time in the house, only going outside for a couple of hours, just enough to stretch their little legs. Some days when it very cold and wet Mars and Jupiter get to play in the house. They are not litter trained like our house bunnies, Flower and Thumper, and this results in a sea of bunny pellets littering the carpet. They don't mind not going out especially if it has been cold for a few days, in fact sometimes when we open their cage to get them out they run off and disappear under our bed.
