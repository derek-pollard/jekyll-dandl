This is Blossom's wound. The photo was taken the day after Blossom removed her stitches from her tumour removal surgery. As far as I understand the white bits you can see are dead flesh, not her insides poking out, which is what it looks like to me! While nothing is being done surgically to heal Blossom's wound she is still under the care of a vet and taking antibiotics to prevent infection, plus painkillers to keep her comfortable.
