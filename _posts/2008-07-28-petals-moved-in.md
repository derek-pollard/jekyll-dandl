I was cleaning the girls out and decided to let them all play together while I worked. Because Daisy, Peach and Apricot are so young and full of energy I had previously moved them into the Furplast Furet Plus that we'd bought for Petal.

I cleaned Daisy and her daughters cage our first and, as they are never impressed with cleaning out time, they disappeared into the smaller cage Petal is living in. As Petal didn't seem to mind I left them too it and it kept them out of my way while I was busy.

However, once the big cage was clean and back in place, Petal decided she was going to move back in - it had been her home after all. I extracted Daisy, Peach and Apricot from Petal's cage and they followed Petal over to the big cage.

Well, by the time I had finished cleaning the smaller cage all four girls seemed happy and settled in the big cage together, so I left them too it. Last time I checked on them the were all heading off to different beds. I'm going to keep my fingers crossed and hope it's going to be that simple.
