My two beautiful girls are doing very well with everything they have and are going through. They have both slowed down and don't spend a lot of time out of their home anymore, not even for a cuddle. Don't worry, they still get lots of fuss, they just prefer all their attention while in their cage. Sometimes they are not in the easiest to reach positions, but Derek and I always make sure they get as much fuss as they want.

Sadly milkshake sharing is no longer an activity as they don't want to come out for any and it's not easy to give to them in their home, but they seem happy that way. We still have plenty of yummy treats they do enjoy along with their fuss so we still interact and spoil them whenever we can.

Opal and Ruby are still in wonderful condition, except where Opal's fur hasn't quite grown back fully after her surgery. She's still beautiful and they have the most gorgeous fur, very soft to the touch. We've known a lot of rats with different fur types, and these girl's is really luxurious. We love our two girls so very much and are making the most of everyday we have them.
