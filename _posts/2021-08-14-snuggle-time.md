{% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Lindsay and Ruby" class="size-full wp-image-9976" title="Our senior rat, Ruby, enjoying and milkshake from the comfort of my shoulder" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/post_0706.jpg" alt="Lindsay and Ruby" height="295" %}Little Opal and Ruby are doing fairly well without their two more outgoing sisters. Having always been quite shy, they are now senior ladies and have the right to be less active.

Sadly both girls have developed new tumours, both in the same place in their abdomens, which is upsetting, but they are doing well. With their age and the fact they've both had surgeries, we decided not to put them through more operations. It is a difficult decision as we had to weigh up the risks against simply enjoying our remaining time together.

Without the encouragement of Sapphire and Topaz, Ruby and Opal don't want to come out and play very often. They do still like a cuddle though and their milkshake treat. Our girls have earned a bit of pampering, so Derek and I will do whatever we can to make them feel safe and enjoy a some out of the cage time with us. We love our beautiful girls so very much and are enjoying spoiling them as much as we can.
