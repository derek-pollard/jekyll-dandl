All is well with our two little ratie girls. I'm thrilled to say Maple made a full recovery after her operation, and we have found no other lumps. Without the disruptive influence of our sweet girl, Kiki, Maple and Dora are enjoying a rather sedate life. They still like to come out to play and cuddle, but I'm pretty sure that while they miss Kiki, they don't miss her bouncing around on them and treating the beds as trampolines.

Before Maple's operation we had already downsized their home from the rattie palace to a Ferplast Furret. It is a much more manageable cage for me, but most importantly it is more suited to Dora and Maple's activity levels. There is less chance of them falling and of course they have all their favourite beds. We all miss Mitzi, Tangy and pesky Kiki, but things are peaceful and our girls seem very content with their lives, which makes us very happy.
