We didn't know how old Petal was, but we had always assumed she wasn't a young rat. Still we had hoped that we'd be able to share a little more time with her. Although we hadn't originally planned to adopt Petal, it is now hard to imagine not having had her in our lives.

While it is always hard for us to say goodbye to any of our rats, we can take comfort in the fact that Petal didn't suffer she really did just slip away peacefully. We were very lucky to have known such a special little rat as Petal and to have given her her own little rattie family, who she adored.
