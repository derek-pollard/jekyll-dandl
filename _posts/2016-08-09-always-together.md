After their initial surgery things looked really good for our girls, they had healed up and were back to their naughty selves. Unfortunately after a month or so we noticed Maisy had a lump growing. We have a one surgery rule with our little rats, as it is so much for them to go through. This was especially true with the problems we had with both Blossom and Maisy. With this in mind we were sad, but wanted to give our beautiful girl the best time possible, spoiling her and making sure she was as happy and healthy as possible.

Things were going well with Maisy, although her lump was pretty fast growing she was coping and having fun. Then about a week ago, we found a hole on Blossom's tummy. We'd been keeping a very close eye on both the girls after their tumours, so we were sure Blossom's wound wasn't an abscess. It was a terrible wound that appeared to have come from nowhere, so we rushed her straight to the vet. Our vet thought it may have been a urine infection, as the wound was located around Blossom's urethra. Her thinking was Blossom may have caused the wound herself playing with the area. Blossom was prescribed babytril, metacam and we were given some ointment to treat the wound.

At first Blossom seemed to be doing fairly well and over the next few days the wound seemed to improve, but then it started to get worse again. Blossom went back to the vet for a check up, and our vet decided to call around for some advice as to what to do next. Sadly that night her condition deteriorated further. She became very subdued as the pain caught up with her.

Both Blossom and Maisy had coped so well with their surgeries and Blossom's hideous open wound, so we knew she was really suffering to be so lethargic. The next day we took her back to the vets and considered all our options and the possibility her wound may have been caused by a very nasty and aggressive tumour. This combined with the rapidly growing tumour Maisy had was starting to affect her walking, we made the incredibly painful decision to put both our beautiful girls to sleep.

It was a terrible day for us, and one I don't think we will get over for some time.
