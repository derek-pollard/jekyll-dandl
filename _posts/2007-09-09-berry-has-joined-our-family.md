Because we love to interact with our little family members we weren't sure if we could keep up with another pair of young gerbils. Baby gerbils are incredibly fast and sitting on the floor with them is not as enjoyable as it was 10 years ago :-).

We had put Cheddar's old cage in the loft, just in case, which turned out to be a very fortunate move after a trip to the pet store to get a [bunny cage](/pets/bunnies/fern/ "Fern"), we came home with Berry. The pet superstore we visited ran their own rehoming scheme and when we saw the cute little black gerbil curled up all by himself we just could not resist. Berry is six months old and his previous parents had just dumped him in a cardboard box outside the pet store, and he was looking for a new family.

As Berry has not been handled very much, if at all, he is very jumpy and we are taking our time with him. He has managed to bite us a couple of times already, and we are being very careful because we don't want it to become a habit with him. He is obviously very upset by everything he has been through and the last thing we want is to make things worse.

With a lot of patience, tender loving care, and sunflowers we hope Berry will calm down and realise we are not big scary ogres. Until then we are happy to give him all the time and patience he needs to settle in and be happy.
