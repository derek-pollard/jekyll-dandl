It's been two months since we last saw him, we've asked around our local area and searched woodland near our home, but have found no trace of him. At the moment we are still hopeful that he will come home, but the horrible thought that we may never see him again is starting to creep in.

Custard is such a happy little cat with a funny meow, that he used to announce himself when he comes home. We have had a magical six years with Custard in our lives and we really are missing him. Treacle is still happy and healthy and keeping Custards memory alive.

Until we know what has happened to our silly little cat we will always have hope that he may come home, but for now we shall look at his photos and enjoy our memories.
