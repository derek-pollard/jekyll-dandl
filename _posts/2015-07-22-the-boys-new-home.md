My gorgeous little guys can't stay with their sisters forever, so I've ordered them their very own Savic Habitat XL, just like the one they are in now. To lessen the shock of being separated from the girls (again) the cage is going to be set up exactly the same. Once the guys are all settled I will be able to rearrange things at clean out time, make it more exciting for them.

The gerbils are still happy together right now, but it is good to be ready for when we need to separate the boys, we don't want to risk leaving it too late. We are loving having the six gerbils together, watching them grow and learn from each other. After only a few days in a Habitat XL, all the gerbils have learned to come in and out by themselves, which is fantastic. It didn't take a lot to train them as Olive (one of the girls) is very bright and curious and she figured out how to use the ladder straight away, followedÂ by Acorn, then the others all cottoned on. Now they all come and go on their own. Derek and I still take the time to pick everyone out at playtime, it is important to keep strengthening our bond with them, but once they are all out they are free to come and go as they please - and they do.
