We are please to say Petal is making a full recovery from her operation, and despite all the stress surrounding her joining our family, she is a lovely little rat and has been settling in happily. But to give her the best chance at having a long and happy life with us, we knew she needed to have her tumors removed. They were both pretty big compared to the size of her, and because one was under her left arm and the other down at her groin if left to grow they would soon affect her ability to get around and enjoy life.

Having said that it was not easy to leave her at our vets to have her operation. And it was a very difficult day waiting for the call to say she had come through the operation. but the call did come and we were very happy to go and collect our girl and bring her home.

Thankfully, she has bounced back from her operation amazingly well and has not made any attempt to chew her stitches. Although, we do wish she would take things a bit easier instead of climbing all over the sofa and us when she comes out to play.

Only time will tell if her tumors will grow back, but we're not going to worry about that. Instead we're going to enjoy Petal's huge personality and be glad she's ours.

Now most of the stress and worry is over we made a donation to our local RSPCA to cover half of Petal's medical bills. While it was good of them to pay for Petal's treatment and it certainly helped reduce our stress levels slightly, they are a charity and while they should have spotted that Petal wasn't a boy and that she had the tumours we are really happy she's ours. If they had told us she was a girl the day we saw her, we might not have brought her home with us and now we know and love her, that doesn't bear thinking about.
