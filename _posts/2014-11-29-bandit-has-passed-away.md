We had no real warning anything was wrong. I actually thought he was doing a bit better after the death of his brother, but earlier today he suddenly came over all weak so I wrapped him in a soft towel to hold and comfort him, but he slipped away in my hands before we could even understand what was happening.

Having barely had the two boys a year and then loosing them less than a month apart it's hard to know what to think. All I know is I am going to miss them so very much, I cannot express the joy and laughter they bought to our lives with their fun loving antics.
