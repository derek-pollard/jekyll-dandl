Oh goodness what have we done? In our defence it wasn't a rash decision, we were planning to add another cat to our family. It just happened that we got two.

It all started out simply enough. We talked about adding an extra cat to the family and the impact it would have on Inkie and Jessie. With Derek now working from home permanently and lots of cat towers and toys scattered around the house we felt sure we had the time and space for a new arrival. Our initial plan was a little boy seeing as we had two girls. A laid back boy would fit in perfectly and three cats wasn't too crazy was it? {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Rocket and Pebble in their RSPCA photo" class="size-full wp-image-9909" title="Kittens, Rocket and Pebble looking a bit sad" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/post_0005.jpg" alt="Rocket and Pebble in their RSPCA photo" height="362" %} 

Well, that was the plan. Things started to go astray when we visited the website for our local RSCPA shelter. They had the saddest two little kittens I'd ever seen looking for a home. It was love at first sight, so much so I even named them!

Their story wasn't the happiest. This brother and sister were born into what the RSPCA kindly call a multi-cat household. In this case it was a flat with 19 cats! None the cats were vaccinated, so most of them had cat flu, including our little Rocket and Pebble. We were not deterred though, both Inkie and Jessie are fully vaccinated and I felt confident that once settled into their new home, Rocket and Pebble would soon shake their remaining symptoms.

With our hearts set, the next step was to call the RSCPA and find out if four cats would be too many for our home. It turns out the RSPCA work on a cat per-bedroom policy, and fortunately we have four bedrooms. Everything was looking perfect, so the next step was to fill in the adoption forms. Due to Covid the RSCPA shelter is closed to the public, so unlike our previous adoptions when we popped in and visited our cats, everything was being processed by email. We completed the forms and sent them back as fast as we could. Unfortunately it was not fast enough and another family who had been interested in the kittens had reserved them.

It was a bit of a blow to be honest, but it was good that the kittens had found a home. So we carried on our search elsewhere. We did find other kittens, but none of them were ready for rehoming, but that was okay, we were happy to wait.

Then we got a phone call...

About a week after we applied to adopt Rocket and Pebble, the RSPCA called because the previous adoption of the kittens had not gone through and they wanted to know of we were we still interested. You bet we were.

Of course there could be no home visit, so a video was required to show off our super cat friendly home. We got right on with preparing our video, showing off all our cat posts, toys, cat flap, garden and of course Jessie and Inkie. Super excited by our chance to adopt we sent our video straight off. Even though we have adopted three cats from the RSPCA before, we were still nervous about being approved. There was no need to worry though as we got the call the next day, Rocket and Pebble were ours if we wanted to go ahead.

With everything approved for the adoption we were able to visit the little kittens. We had to wear masks while at the RSCPA centre to help protect the staff and animals, but it was a small price to pay to meet our newest family members.

Rocket lived up to his name and came straight to meet us. He's a bit smaller than his sister, Pebble, but what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in confidence. Pebble was a little more reserved, but she did come to see us and happily lay in Derek's arms while I held Rocket. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Visiting Rocket and Pebble at the RSCPA" class="size-full wp-image-9911" title="Visiting Rocket and Pebble at the RSPCA" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/post_rocket-and-pebble.jpg" alt="Visiting Rocket and Pebble at the RSCPA" height="407" %} 

If I thought I loved those little cats before, meeting them just made it all the more real and both Derek and I knew it was meant to be. We had to wait a few more days to bring them home as the RSPCA like to give adopters plenty of time to make 100% sure they want to adopt. Even though there was no way Derek and I were going to change our minds, we were more than happy to wait and prove how committed we were to our little kittens.

We collected Rocket and Pebble yesterday (Sunday) and it was a very happy day for us. There are still a few concerns with the kittens health due to their cat flu. Unfortunately they may never fully recover, being left with a high risk of runny eyes and nose, but Derek and I are prepared for that and we'll deal with whatever comes. For the next few days Pebble also needs eyes drops three times a day, but so far she is being very patient with us while we administer them. Hopefully that won't be for too long and we can get on with introducing Rocket and Pebble to the rest of the family.
