With three degus in the house we're finding it really funny how different they all are. Max is a very noisy little chap. He does have a very varied vocabulary, but mostly he just chooses to squawkÂ at us. While Pip whistles and Roo sings, Max just screeches, and he will make this noise if he wants fuss, letting in or out of his cage, heck sometimes if we just talk to him. It's not a terrible noise, though it can make us jump if we are fussing him, as it's a bit like being yelled at, but to Max it obviously means different things.

Sometimes the noise makes sense, like if he's eating and he thinks maybe you're getting too close, but other times we are baffled what he's on about. At night Max will also squawk at our bunny, Fern if she gets too close to his cage, not that she cares. I think he's just telling her it's his home and to go away, which pretty much sums up Max's attitude towards us, unless he wants a cuddle or some oats :-)

Unlike Pip and Roo, Max is not a wheel fanatic! Just like the other boys he has a posh metal wheel, but he only tends to use it at night before bed and then compared to the other two he only goes for a gentle jog in it. He seems very content though and other than his screeching he is definitely the calmer of the three guys.

As Max had been treated for mites, before we got him, he is very used to being handled and he always loves his fuss, especially a tickle under his chin. It took time before we could fuss Pip, and Roo hates to be touched, but Max has always been a fusspot. He also loves to lie down while out of his cage. Oh yes and he does the most enormous yawns when he's been out too long. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Max chilling on an armchair" class="size-full wp-image-7701" title="Our degu, Max sitting on an armchair" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/post_3645.jpg" alt="Max chilling on an armchair" height="492" %}
