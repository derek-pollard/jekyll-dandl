I have decided if my boys won't come out and play then they'll just have to have a bigger home to live in. The cage is basically the same as their old one just a lot bigger, no kidding it's massive. I'm not sure the boys have figured out what's happened yet, and they seem a little lost in all the extra space. More space means more toys too, so I have been able to add extra beds, shelves and tubes into their home, which means they have to travel further to get to their food and from one bed to another.

The other thing I've bought the guys is a cardboard castle. Even together Derek and I struggled to lift their old cage and put it on the floor, so there was no way we were going to move this one. The castle is really sturdy and the top of it is level with the bottom door of their cage, so it gives them the perfect pace to climb down into. I've also got them some tubes which I can hang out the windows of the castle for them to climd down.

The best thing about their new set up is they seem keener to come out now. I think they like having the castle to disappear into and the tubes give them a sneaky way down. All in all I'm really pleased and while the boys aren't coming out everyday, they do a couple of days a week which is much better for their health and chubbiness levels.
