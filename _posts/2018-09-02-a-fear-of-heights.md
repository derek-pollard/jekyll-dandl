Things have not been going as smoothly as planned with our little gerbils. They are lovely and we adore them, but unfortunately they weren't too keen on their cage. Our last cheeky little gerbils had a great time living in their multileveled Savic Habitat XL, and we thought our new guys would feel the same, they didn't. After allowing time for Sunny and Moomin to settle in, we could see they were not happy. Sunny in particular was very nervous when accessing the higher levels of the cage.

Wanting our little guys to be happy and comfortable, I set about finding them the perfect cage. Over the years we'd had several Ferplast Duna Multy cages in various sizes and our gerbils have always loved them. Seeing as our new boys didn't like heights, the single level cages seemed a great option. The cages come in three sizes. Ferplast had changed the largest size to have a lip around the bottom of the base, and with gerbils that is not a good idea, so we opted for the middle size. It is still a great habitat for two little gerbils, and being lighter than a tank we can still carry the cage around to let our little guys run around on the floor. Due to limited availability of the cage in the UK I had to order it direct from Ferplast. Even so it arrived within a week of ordering and we transferred Sunny and Moonin into their new home as soon as it was ready. The effect on the gerbils was instant and I am thrilled to say Sunny and Moomin are right at home in their new cage.

The boys are like different gerbils, Sunny in particular is super confident and it is amazing to see. He's turned into a right cheeky little guy. It was difficult at first knowing how unhappy our boys were, but seeing how happy we have made them now... well it is a very special feeling.
