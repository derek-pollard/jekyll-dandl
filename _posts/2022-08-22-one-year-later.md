It is hard to believe it was a year ago we brought home Rocket and Pebble from the RSPCA. Every day they bring brightness and joy to my life. Over time they have gradually become more independent and sure of themselves. They no longer spend every meal time crammed into my knee which, as much as I miss it, is probably for the best.  {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Rocket and Pebble all grown up" class="size-full wp-image-10466" title="Rocket and Pebble all grown up" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/one-year-later1.jpg" alt="Rocket and Pebble all grown up" height="470" %} 

With the warm weather they found themselves becoming more relaxed out in the garden. Seeing them playing together in the garden is a wonderful experience. Pebble loves being outside and prefers to play with me in the garden to inside. Rocket is still not fully confident outside but happily spends a fair amount of time there. This matches their use of the cat flap, Pebble using it to get in and out, Rocket however only goes outside if the door is left ajar and although he can use the cat flap to get back in, he gets nervous if he hears the back door being closed. Neither of them have shown any interest in climbing the fences or trees so I donâ€™t know if they can even get up them. They seem quite happy as they are, content that the house and back garden are their world. 

Rocket never did get his growth spurt and turn into a burly boy but at least he caught up with Pebble and they are roughly the same size. Their proportions are funny, while Pebble looks like a miniature cat, Rocket is somewhere between kitten and cat. I still refer to them as the kittens, maybe I always will. 

I am grateful every day that we were accepted for their adoption and for the time Lindsay spent with them. They are a living reminder of her love, kindness and generosity.
