Kiki is adorable in every way, she's fun and bouncy, has a beautiful affectionate temperament, and is very healthy - she just forgot to grow!

When we got Maple and Kiki, they were both super cute little babies and exactly the same size. Maple had her breathing problems when we first got her, but after a week of Baytril she was fine, and despite her poorliness grew as normal, Kiki on the other hand did not. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Kiki next to her larger sister, Maple" class="size-full wp-image-10023" title="My little rat, Kiki next to her larger sister, Maple" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/post_3253.jpg" alt="Kiki next to her larger sister, Maple" height="496" %} 

I know it didn't, but it all seemed to happen overnight. Maple and Kiki moved in with the Twiglets and the next thing I knew Maple was this stocky healthy rat and the biggest out of the five girls and Kiki hadn't changed. Obviously she lost that baby rat shape and now looks like a proper rat, but compared to the other girls she is tiny. Not that we mind what size she is, as long as all the girls are all happy, healthy and bouncy we're not worried, but it is funny to see her next to Maple. It's hard to believe they were ever the same size!
