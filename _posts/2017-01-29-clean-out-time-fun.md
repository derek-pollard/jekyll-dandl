Like every good gerbily parent Derek and I clean our gerbils cage every week. As well as keeping their home nice and tidy, it gives us an opportunity to move things around and keep an eye on the wear and tear on their toys. They boys love to play, just like their sisters, but they are always keen to go in after clean out day and see what's changed and give their gerbily approval.
