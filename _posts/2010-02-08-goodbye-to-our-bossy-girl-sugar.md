Our much loved little girl, Sugar passed away quietly yesterday. Over the past week she had become gradually weaker and weaker, but still enjoying lots of baby food, until her appetite dropped off completely and she was struggling to walk. I moved her from the cage she shares with her sisters into a very cosy bed I made for her with soft towels in a shoebox. Being so very weak and with being wrapped up all safe and warm, she wasn't interested in wandering off. I kept her in there for a few days, checking on her regally and changing her towels when she went to the loo and washing her face and eyes. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Derek holding Sugar" class="size-full wp-image-9047" title="Our sweet rat, Sugar nestled in Derek's arms" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/post_1098.jpg" alt="Derek holding Sugar" height="426" %} 

When Derek and I got up on Sunday morning she seemed very week and her breathing was shallow. I took her out of her box and was cleaning her up when she gave a big breath and passed away. While it breaks my heart that she is gone, it was very special that she had held on all night and died in my hands.

Sugar had always been a very bossy, and sometimes difficult, rat, but I loved her so much. It may sound silly, but I believe it was a gift, and maybe a thank you from Sugar, that I got to see her pass quietly and peacefully.
