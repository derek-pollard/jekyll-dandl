Little Max has been adding to the degu drama, and though he seems to be though the worst of his illness Derek and I are still very concerned for our little guy. It started Wednesday night, we'd played with him in the afternoon and he seemed his usual bossy-self. Come bedtime though that had all changed. Max was up in his hammock covered with a piece of kitchen towel, he did not respond to us, come out to play or show any interest in his new food. We weren't sure what to think, he'd been fine only hours before so we went to bed hoping he'd feel better in the morning. He didn't.

By Friday it was obvious things weren't going to improve on their own, so we took him to the vet first thing. The vet checked his teeth and felt his tummy, but everything seemed fine. She didn't want to do anything to drastic, like x-ray him as that would require giving him gas to calm him down and keep him still. Instead she gave him an injection of pain killer and something to help his tummy if he was feeling a bit poorly. She also equipped us with some syringes to feed him with.

As soon as we got home a grumbly Max went straight back to bed and I ground up some of his pellets and left them in water to go all mushy. The pellets created quite a disgusting concoction, but I loaded up a syringe and did my best to feed Max. He was not impressed, but he was, at least, to weak to resist.

It took twelve long hours, but Derek and I are happy to report we have seen some improvement in Max's condition. He's up and about a and picking at little bits of hay. We don't know if his improvements is because of the injections, or it if will wear off, but we are very hopeful his condition will continue to improve.
