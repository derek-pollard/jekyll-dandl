It's funny to think that Smudge was our least favourite of the five girls we adopted from the RSPCA. It's not that we didn't want her, although I don't think I will ever be a fan of dumbo rats, it's the fact that when we first got her she continually and aggressively attacked and bit my hands. I remember she would charge from across the room if I put my hand on the floor and give me a really nasty bite. Oddly she never bit Derek, it was always me!

It didn't take much to break Smudge of her bad habit, just time patience and love. Smudge would never bite me if I was holding her, so that's what I did - I picked her up at every opportunity and wouldn't put her down until she'd had a good cuddle. And it worked; Smudge and I became great friends.

After the last of her sisters passed away I got two new little rats, who Smudge shares a home with and we hardly ever see her! Smudge is content sleeping the day away in her igloo and getting up when she thinks we have some yummies for her. Not that I mind, if Smudge is happy then I'm happy.

It's just funny how things have turned out. Smudge has gone from being our least favourite little rat, to a very precious little family member.
