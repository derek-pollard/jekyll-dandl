It has been just over two months since we adopted these guys and they have settled into our family really well. They took awhile to adjust to their new surroundings and family and the two girls nipped our fingers a few times. The biggest change we noticed was in the state of their fur. As the rats had just been treated for lice their fur was not in the best of conditions when we collected them. Bourbon in particular looked the worst out of the bunch, his fur was fairly thin in places. It only took a few weeks for Bourbon's fur to return to it's shiny healthy condition and he certainly is a very handsome rat.

All is not perfect though our new bunch are terrible gnawers and will chomp through anything we put in their home. I spent a long time making them hammocks and other cosy places to sleep, but this silly little bunch like to lie in them chomping their way through until it collapses, dropping them and whoever is napping in there with them onto the floor, what a silly bunch. I have made them lots more things to sleep in/chew up out of any old fabric I can find and as long as long no one gets hurt we don't mind. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Cookie and Bourbon and Coral & Clover our and about" class="size-full wp-image-7163" title="Four gorgeous rats Cookie & Bourbon and Coral & Clover" src="/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/postbanner_cbcc.jpg" alt="Cookie and Bourbon and Coral & Clover our and about" height="353" %}
