Phew, the heatwave passed and I'm very happy to say we all survived. Our garden sprang back to life, with some much needed summer rain.

Fern has been busy enjoying the spoils of our lovely little garden and is back to sleeping under shrubs and other hard to find her places. Here she is enjoying some pyracantha berries. She turns into even more of a crazy bunny when she gets these, wanting more and more, so we have to watch how many we give her.
