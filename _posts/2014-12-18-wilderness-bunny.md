We have two bird feeders in the garden, which hold fat balls. The birds love them and so, it seems, does Fern.

We'd noticed her hanging around underneath the bird feeders foraging around and eating something. With the time of year we thought maybe it was leaves, but no Fern is eating the bits of food the birds drop. It's not clear exactly what she is eating, whether its the fat itself or bits of seed that get dropped, but there is definitely something yummy, as Fern is spending a lot of time underneath both feeders having a good nosh.

Fern has always been a very healthy bunny, choosing to eat fresh grass and hay over her bunny nuggets and other treats, so we guess she knows what is good for her. It's hard to believe she's over seven now, as she is still so full of energy and personality, doing her own thing and playing with our cats.

Even after all these years Fern is still surprising us with her antics, and we never know what she is going to do next.
