<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6505" title="Our gerbil, Barely sitting on Lindsay's arm" src="/wp-content/uploads/2001/12/post_4573.jpg" alt="Our gerbil, Barely sitting on Lindsay's arm" width="310" height="231" />Derek has been checking little Barleys mouth for the last couple of weeks to look for her new teeth and make sure she is okay. On our last check there was the sight of one little tooth regrowing, which is a great relief to us. Barley is getting a bit fed up with the baby food, but now we are tempting her with broken up sunflower seeds and she is managing to eat them. We know she still has a way to go before she is fully over her little teeth incident, but it is wonderful to see signs of improvement.

I'm pretty sure Barely will also be very happy to have her teeth back and start chomping her way through some cardboard again! She's already started tearing her way through her cardboard, she still can't chew it, but its a start.
