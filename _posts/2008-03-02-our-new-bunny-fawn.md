No, Fern wanted to live outside and she made sure we knew it. We had hoped that as a house bunny Fern would be happy with our company, but outside in the garden we were worried she would be lonely. So, along came our second dwarf bunny Fawn.

We were at a large pet superstore that we don’t normally visit. Unfortunately they are the only place in our local area that sold something I needed for my rats. Fawn was this little black bundle in the middle of a good-sized bunny area, the problem was all the other bunnies were bigger than him and he looked terrified. Derek, being the big softie he is about bunnies, couldn’t resist.

When we picked the little bunny up, we found he had scabs and little bald spots on his back, where the other bigger bunnies were obviously biting him. Even though we both know it is wrong to support these places and buy animals from them, there was no way I was going to get Derek to put the bunny back, and so Fawn joined our family.

Fawn is living in Fern’s old giant indoor bunny cage in the bedroom that was supposed to be hers, before she decided to be an outside bunny. He also has lots of bunny toys and tunnels to keep him entertained and of course we hope to spend lots of time playing with him.
