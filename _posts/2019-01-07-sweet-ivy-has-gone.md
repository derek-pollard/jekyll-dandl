We tried so very hard to save our little girl, but sadly it wasn't meant to be and we had to put her to sleep. To say we are devastated is an understatement. We have lost so many rats and to say goodbye to one so very young is almost too much to bear. We loved Ivy, like all our little rats, very much, so life without her will take some getting used to. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Ivy enjoying cold tea" class="size-full wp-image-8741" title="Our little rat, Ivy, enjoying some cold tea from Derek's hand" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/post_0086.jpg" alt="Ivy enjoying cold tea" height="585" %} 

On a brighter note, Sundew is coping surprisingly well, and we will continue to support her in her epic rattie adventures and her love of yummy treats. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Sundew and Jessie, on an adventure" class="size-full wp-image-8743" title="Our rat, Sundew drinking from a water bowl, while our black cat, Jessie watches her" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/post_0098.jpg" alt="Sundew and Jessie, on an adventure" height="705" %}
