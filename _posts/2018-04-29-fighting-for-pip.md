Oh my goodness, Pip is going through it at the moment. Despite our best efforts the wound on his back leg is not healing. We have been forced to put a plastic collar round his neck, which isn't nice, but it means we can apply skin healing medicine directly to his wound. UnfortunatelyÂ the collar has meant we've had to stop his antibiotics. Pip is very highly strung, and it was all getting too much for him. The antibiotic, even though watered down, doesn't taste nice and combined with being manhandled twice a day, the poor little chap was getting so stressed just knowing we were coming for him. Hopefully the cream will help, and I can apply it to his wound at playtime and he seems none the wiser.

He went for a check up last week, and had a biopsy of his wound and some healthy tissue to make sure there is no skin condition involved. It would explain why he isn't healing. For now though we have to stick with the collar, just to be sure its not Pip himself preventing the wound from healing up.
