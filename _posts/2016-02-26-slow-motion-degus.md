One of the first things I learnt about degus is how much they love running wheels, and Max proved this to be true. So, when I got the boys I again made sure I got them a nice large wheel. Derek got this great slow motion footage of Roo running in his wheel, and Pip makes a guess appearance to show how much degus like jumping too.
