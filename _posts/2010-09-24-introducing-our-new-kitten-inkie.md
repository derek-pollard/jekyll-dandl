I had always joked that if anything happened to Treacle I would adopt a grumpy old cat from the RSPCA in his memory. Obviously at 14 weeks old Inkie is not a grumpy old cat, but she is from the RSPCA.

Over the weekend while Derek and I were coming to terms with the loss of our cat Treacle, last Friday, we talked about adopting another cat. I was serious about wanting an older cat, but Derek wasn't so sure. He felt a younger cat would adapt better to living with our bunnies. Also, after loosing both Treacle and Custard to age related illnesses an older cat may not have been the best choice for us.

We popped up to our local RSPCA on Monday to have a little look at the cats and see how we felt. It was love at first sight when we saw Inkie. She was curled up fast asleep at the front of her cat pen and I knew instantly Derek was right about adopting a younger cat.

Knowing we'd need a home visit before we could take Inkie home, we registered our interest in adopting Inkie and planned to visit her the following Thursday and Saturday and then see how far along the adoption process was by then. Derek and I were really surprised when we got a 'phone call on Wednesday asking if we'd be available for a home visit that afternoon. Of course we said, "Yes."

The home inspection went well and the next day we got a phone call informing us we'd been approved to adopt Inkie and we could collect her tomorrow (which is today, Friday). Once we knew we'd be collecting Inkie the next day, we decided not to go and visit her at the shelter. The staff are always very busy and it seemed silly to get in their way. It was difficult though and I did have a little sulk, so Derek took me out to buy a few more cat things ready for her arrival. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Inkie's new bedroom" class="size-full wp-image-6010" title="Our spare bedroom, now devoted to cats" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/post_1731.jpg" alt="Inkie's new bedroom" height="405" %} 

So, at 1.30 today we arrived ready and very excited to collect our new little kitten. Once home, Derek and I sat with her while she looked around her new bedroom, had a drink, some food and then popped to the toilet! Then as expected she found a nice comfy bed and fell fast asleep.
