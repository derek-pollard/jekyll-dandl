Fawn and Treacle have become such good friends, they are like an old married couple! It is all a bit daft really, we have two bunnies that won't get along, but both want to be friends with our cat, Treacle.

Poor Treacle is quite old now, and Fawn gets very excited when Treacle is around, but Treacle just wants to sleep. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Nap time" class="size-full wp-image-6635" title="Our bunny, Fawn and his feline friend, Treacle enjoying sitting in two armchairs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/post_1456.jpg" alt="Nap time" height="562" %} 

Well, this picture just about sums up life in our house, and how much Fawn loves being with Treacle.
