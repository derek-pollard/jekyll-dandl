This time it is our cuddly boy Apple. Like his brother, Lime, he'd been unwell for some time and he passed away quietly in the night. We found him laying in his hammock this morning looking like he was fast asleep. It was a terrible shock, especially after only just loosing Lime, but he really did look like he passed away peacefully. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Lime and Apple" class="size-full wp-image-8994" title="Holding my two boy rats, Lime and Apple" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/post_2489.jpg" alt="Lime and Apple" height="437" %} 

We are going to make sure that his cheeky little brother Bramble gets lots of extra spoiling and of course he has his new friends Chestnut and Conker, who are lovely boys, to keep him company.
