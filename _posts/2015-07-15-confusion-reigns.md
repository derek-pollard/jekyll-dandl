Our girls are very young and when they are small, gerbils can be difficult to sex. We've become a little concerned that Cherry is actually a boy. The chap who bred them wasn't 100% sure she was female, though he was fairly certain. While playing with the girls we started to wonder about Cherry. We are pretty sure she is a female, but don't really want to take any chances with Cherry's future happiness, so we decided the best thing to do was go back to the store and get [their brothers](/gerbils/acorn-almond-cashew/) - it makes sense to us :-) The gerbils are still young enough to live together, and as they'd only been apart for one day we had no problems putting them all together again. Given an extra week or two we should know where we are with Cherry and the babies can be separated by gender and everyone will be safe and happy.

It may seem bit crazy, as we'll end up with two cages of gerbils, but it was the best option for us and the gerbils. There was no way I could part with little Cherry if she is a boy, but it would be cruel of me to force her to live as a lone gerbil just so I can keep her. I'm not complaining about the extra gerbils, I secretly wanted them all at the time, and now I have my way no matter what happens! Being lucky enough to stay home and care for our family, one extra cage is no extra bother and I have plenty of time to make sure everyone gets lots of attention and play time.
