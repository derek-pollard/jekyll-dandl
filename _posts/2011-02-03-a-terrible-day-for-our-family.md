Our beautiful, sweet little bunny, Fawn has passed away. It is very difficult for us to accept he is gone. At only 3 years of age we were not ready to say goodbye to our bouncy little chap.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6641" title="Our sweet bunny, Fawn exploring a large paper bag" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/post_0849.jpg" alt="Our sweet bunny, Fawn exploring a large paper bag" width="780" height="400" /> 

We had begun to suspect there was something wrong with Fawn, when his appearance started to change. At first we just thought he was molting, as his fur looked a little unkempt. Then we noticed his energy levels had dropped slightly, it was very slow at first, he just didn't seem quite his usual bouncy self. He would come and see us in our home office in the morning as normal and then he'd spend all day asleep. His interest in playing with the cats had also waned. The real shock came when we realised he had also lost some weight. We booked him an appointment to see a vet the next day.

<img class="size-full wp-image-6640 alignright" title="Out sweet bunny, Fawn sitting in an armchair" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/post_1255.jpg" alt="Out sweet bunny, Fawn sitting in an armchair" width="390" height="347" /> The vet suggested that Fawn's problem could be worms, and gave us some worming paste for him. We have had no experience with worms in any of our previous bunnies, and were glad the vet had diagnosed something quite simple and treatable. We also got Fawn's teeth checked, he has a history of dental problems and although he still seemed to be eating okay, it seemed best to ask. The vet felt that Fawn's teeth did need treating again, and so we booked him in for a dental the following week. If neither of these two treatments helped we'd then move on to more serious tests for Fawn.

Throughout the week waiting for Fawn's operation we became more concerned for our little bunny. He was still acting happy enough, but we both had this feeling that felt there was something seriously wrong.

The day of Fawn's dental arrived and we weren't happy at the thought of our little bunny undergoing an anaesthetic while he was so poorly. We took Fawn to the vets and voiced our concerns for our poor little bunny. The veterinary nurse checked with the on-call vet and he confirmed Fawn was in need of a dental.

Derek and I still had an uneasy feeling about leaving Fawn, but we did, as not treating his teeth would only make Fawns problems worse. Two hours later we got the terrible call that Fawn had passed away. We were told that his surgery hadn't even begun and that they had only just started to give him the anaesthetic.

It was absolutely devastating news for us. Even though both Derek and I were sure there was something dreadfully wrong with our beautiful bunny, we were in no way prepared to loose him.

Life is going to be very different without Fawn in our home. We work from home and Fawn running around our home office, kicking his legs and wobbling his head was a daily occurrence, one that we are going to miss everyday.
