It is with very sad heart that I have to say that Topaz has another lump. This time under the other armpit, and I think this time it is best we don't do anything about it. We love Topaz so very much, like we do all our girls, but another surgery would be too much for her, and of course there could be more lumps. She is very happy and active, although I did notice before her last surgery she had lost a bit of weight. She's not skinny, but she is no longer as muscular as her sisters, though that does not stop her getting into all sorts of trouble.

There is always a risk with rats and lumps, but fortunately we've never experienced recurring lumps. We are going to do everything we can to keep Topaz happy and healthy for as long as we can. For now we are trying to stay positive for our little girl.

Ruby made a full recovery form her surgery, which is wonderful news, and her fur is growing back nicely. Hopefully she and the other girls will remain lump free, and we can enjoy and love our rattie family for a long time to come. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Our four girls, Ruby, Topaz, Sapphire and Opal, being camera shy in the bottom left" class="size-full wp-image-9750" title="Our four rats climbing on their cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/post_9845.jpg" alt="Our four girls, Ruby, Topaz, Sapphire and Opal being camera shy in the bottom left" height="662" %}
