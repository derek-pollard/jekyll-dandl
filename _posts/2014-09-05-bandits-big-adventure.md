Today our super brave boy, Bandit snuck out of the office! With having two cats in the house we are usually very careful to keep the office door blocked, so no rats can leave nor any cats get in. Our cats are pretty soppy creatures and probably wouldn't hurt any of our rats, but it's best not to take a chance. Still all our precautions didn't stop Bandit sneaking out of the office today and having a good explore. Rather than tell him off and send him back, we blocked off the stairs to keep him safe from cats and let him have a good look around.

The first thing Bandit encountered was a cardboardÂ cat house we bought for our little cat Inkie. Bandit thought it was marvellous and was soon running from one end to the other. When Wombat heard all the fun he came trundling out too, though he was a little more cautious of his new surroundings.

After the cardboard house Bandit discovered the cats room and had a wonderful time exploring in all their cat beds, tunnels and cushions. He really is a very brave boy, and is defiantly living up to his name. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="'Where's Bandit gone now?'" class="size-full wp-image-6370" title="Our rat Wombat peering out of the office" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/post_1021.jpg" alt="'Where's Bandit gone now?'" height="261" %}
