Even before the gerbil population doubled in our house we had ordered our little girls a new home. I've had my eye on the Savic Habitat XL for quite some time. It always looked like a fantastic gerbil home, mixing two different cage types, a tank on the bottom and wire frame on top to give gerbils the best of both worlds. Well, as soon as our girls joined the family I knew they had to have one. The cage has a lovely big door that with some ladders will be great for the gerbils to climb in and out of at play time, always an important feature for buying gerbils cages.

We'd had the cage a few days before we introduced the gerbils to it, wanting to give them time to settle in, especially with the boys arriving too. Today we took the plunge and transferred our gerbils to their new home, and they absolutely love it. The cage actually comes with a wire shelf for the top part of the cage, but we weren't too sure of its safety for little gerbil feet, especially while they are babies. Instead we've given them a wooden ledge, a rope scramble net and a wooden ramp to get up there. I may reintroduce the wire shelf when the gerbils are bigger, especially if they chew the scramble rope to bits! For now though, other than jumping off things, which can't be helped in any cage, the gerbils are safe. All six are still together and although the cage is not big enough for six gerbils it is fine while they are babies, and we intend to purchase another cage before we need to separate them.
