I am very happy, and relieved, to say Ivy came through her surgery and has made a full recovery. It was a very distressing time for all of us. Derek and I worrying about Ivy's surgery, Sundew worrying where her little daughter was and of course for poor Ivy who didn't understand what was happening. But we all made it through the surgery and were thrilled to bring our sweet girl back home.

The surgery was successful, although the vet did find something strange inside Ivy's womb that was a little odd, still everything went well and we are not expecting any complications. Because Ivy is an adopted rat, we don't know anything about her previous history, whether someone had tried to breed from her before which was what caused her problems and the mass that was found, we will never know. The most important thing is the lump was not a tumour and like I said apart from recovering from the surgery Ivy was just happy to be home.

Ivy was on a lot of medication after surgery, which she did not appreciate at all. Unfortunately she did develop a slight infection around one of her stitches, but this was cleared up quickly. Despite the vet wanting us to keep Ivy still and alone after surgery, she had other ideas and after just one night without her family, Ivy was obviously struggling emotionally. She was very lethargic, which we tried to tell ourselves was the surgery, but the morning after surgery we introduced her back to her family and of course she was as happy as can be, like a switch had flicked.

It is all over now though and Ivy is fully healed and back to her shy little self. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Our Beautiful Ivy" class="size-full wp-image-8733" title="Our beautiful rat, Ivy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/post_0078.jpg" alt="Our Beautiful Ivy" height="585" %}
