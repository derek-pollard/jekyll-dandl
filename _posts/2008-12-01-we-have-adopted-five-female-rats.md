We had said we weren't going to take anymore rats in, and when the RSPCA phoned us about five girls who were looking for a home we initially said no. We stuck to our resolve for a few weeks, but couldn't stop thinking about the rats. The RSPCA have a hard enough time rehoming rats as it is, never mind five. Then there is the age of the girls. It has been our experience that whatever age the people giving the rats up tell the RSPCA is usually wrong. Sadly this turned out to be the case with these girls. We went along expecting three rats who were one year old and two dumbo rats who were six months. While the dumbos are still young the other three are definitely not the same age. I believe that possibly one of the rats, Pearl is around one, but the other two, Kiwi & Sugar are nearer two years of age, if not over. One thing is for sure they are not young rats.

As we now have so many rats, we have cleared out what was the guest room and turned it into the rats room. We have moved our other girls, [Daisy, Peach & Apricot](/daisy-peach-apricot/ "Daisy, Peach & Apricot") into the rat room too and while the girls live in separate cages they will get to play together and cause all kinds of rattie mayhem.
