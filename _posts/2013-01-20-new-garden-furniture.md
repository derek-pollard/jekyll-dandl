Our bunny is as full of adventure as ever and climbing on our picnic table is one of her favourite hobbies, unfortunately we're not so keen on it. Its not that we don't want her to climb and explore, its just with two cats in the garden and other things to startle our bunny, we're just not sure her being so high up is safe. Not even snow and ice will stop Fern scaling the table, if anything it seems to be 'the slippier the better'.

Recently a neighbours dog barked and startled Fern into jumping off the top table without planning. She landed okay, but we started to worry she was going to get hurt. As well as that, the picnic table is old and getting rather wobbly so we thought we'd all benefit from some new garden furniture. We have gone for a nice garden bench, it's not as high as the picnic table, is sturdier and provides Fern with a stable place to climb and play - well that was the plan anyway... {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="'You can't stop me!'" class="size-full wp-image-6195" title="Our bunny Fern sitting on a snow covered bench" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/post_0716.jpg" alt="Our bunny Fern sitting on a snow covered bench" height="367" %}
