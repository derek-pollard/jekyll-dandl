Our little Fern has been having trouble jumping in and out of her cage and she keeps getting her toes caught in the open doorway. Rather than wait for Fern to hurt herself Derek has made her a fancy wooden ramp, so Fern can hop in and out of her cage whenever she wants. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Fern demonstrating her new cage ramp" class="size-full wp-image-6264" title="Our baby bunny using her new cage ramp" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/post_9506.jpg" alt="Fern demonstrating her new cage ramp" height="331" %} 

Of course, Fern helped throughout the process. Keeping an eye on what we were doing and even trying to pinch one of the legs and a screw driver. She is a very bossy bunny.
