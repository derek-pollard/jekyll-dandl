We have had to make the difficult decision to have our mischievous little girl, Kiki put to sleep. She had developed very severe breathing difficulties and even with a strong course of Baytril she was getting progressively worse, until we knew we had to let her go.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/post_0858.jpg" alt="Our sweet little rat, Kiki, eating a bran flake on her cage doorway" title="Our sweet little rat, Kiki, eating a bran flake on her cage doorway" width="470" height="417" class="alignright size-full wp-image-10032" /> Since we first knew her our sweet little Kiki has been a boisterous rat. Always on the go, she was always the first out the cage and to find trouble to get herself in. Over the past few days she was feeling so poorly she barely moved and was horribly cold to touch. She had taken to sitting cuddled up on me while I worked on my computer. Normally it would be such a lovely experience, but to see little Kiki like that was heart breaking.

Yesterday morning she had been with me and as the day progressed her condition was obviously deteriorating and though to weak to show it we could see she was suffering. With nothing but love in our hearts we called our vets and rushed her straight down to let her go peacefully.

Little Kiki was the smallest rat we'd ever known, but she was also an incredibly healthy and bouncy little creature, which made her sudden illness even more difficult to understand. We don't know if it was somehow linked to how poorly her sister Maple was as a baby, or something completely random. Either way, we are missing our sweet little Kiki very much. The rattie palace is very quiet without her.
