    Goodness, we have gone and done it again, two little boy ratties to get into all sorts of trouble while we're not paying attention. Toffee and Caramel came from our local pet shop. We had been talking about getting some more rats for a couple of weeks. It had all started when we were in the pet shop getting some supplies, doesn't it always? Derek had gone off to look at the baby bunnies, naughty Derek, and while over in the pets section I spotted a very handsome little rattie climbing up the side of the cage watching us. We managed to escape the pet shop without any additions to our family, but I couldn't stop thinking about the cute rattie I had seen.

    The following Saturday we were back at the pet shop for more supplies, we're not very organised with our pet supplies ;-), and I wanted to see if the rat was still there. He wasn't, but there were some different rats in his place. As we had gone to the pet shop on our bicycles there was no way we could take any rats home with us, so again we left without any new additions to the family. Later that afternoon after lots of talking and convincing from me, we decided to go back to the pet shop and get the rats we had seen, so we jumped in our car and popped round. By the time we got there all the ratties had been sold and we had to leave empty handed again. We had found out from a member of staff that they were expecting some baby rats in on Thursday. This time we were not going to miss out!

    As soon as Derek got home from work on Thursday night we jumped in our car and headed out. When we got to the pet shop there was a bundle of girl rats asleep in one cage and a bundle of boys asleep in the other. They were all Champaign coloured rats, either Berkshire (all one colour with a white tummy) or hooded. There was one little chap who was up and about, he was the only black hooded rat and for me it was love at first sight. Derek then chose a Champaign Berkshire rattie and we headed off home with our new family members.

    Of course the first night we left the little ratties alone in their new cage to settle in. The next day we opened up their cage, still expecting the baby rats to be a bit shy, but Toffee came spilling out as if he'd known us all along. Little Caramel took a bit more convincing, but he too spent some time out of his new home.

    We hadn't had baby rats since Biscuit, Badger and Willow back in 2002. All our rats since then had come to us fully grown, so we had kind of forgotten what a handful the little things could be. Toffee and Caramel have certainly reminded us. Toffee is a crazy little chap and he has wasted no time in bonding with both of us. Caramel is a little bit more timid than his brother, but Toffee is a force of nature and even a shy rat like Caramel has been swept up in his enthusiasm.

    At the moment the baby rats are living in a large hamster cage as they are both small enough to fit through the bars of their giant ratty cage. The little rats don't mind their temporary home, it is plenty high enough for them to practice their climbing and it's full of things to play in and explore. And of course we are spending lots of time with them, getting to know them and letting them explore their new home. One of Toffee and Carmel's favourite things is to play in their giant rattie home, even though they're not big enough to live in it, this doesn't stop them treating it like a giant activity centre. The little chaps also enjoy running around on our computer desks and playing with our computer wires, nothing has fallen victim to tiny rattie teeth yet, but there is plenty of time for chewing things they shouldn't.
