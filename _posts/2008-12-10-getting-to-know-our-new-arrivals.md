I would love to say things are going smoothly with our new arrivals and we are all getting on well, but we are not. I understand the bond rats form with us humans, and the pain it must cause them when they are forgotten, or in my girls' case given away. Some of them have obviously been more hurt than the others and are acting out in different ways. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Kiwi and Pearl looking for the exit" class="size-full wp-image-9018" title="Two of our rats, Kiwi and Pearl, leaning up a closed door" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/post_3332.jpg" alt="Kiwi and Pearl looking for the exit" height="571" %} 

Firstly Kiwi is a bit destructive, she likes to pull up the carpet, chews are the bars of her cage and the base and other plastic bits she can reach. We are a bit concerned she is actually going to chew her way out of the cage. Pearl and Sugar also chew the bars of their cage, which is very noisy especially at nighttime, but we can hope that they will settle down.Â All the rats get a bit mischievous if we let them run around too long. On average they can stay out for about 10 minutes, before they start getting tired and troublesome. Hopefully they will get used to being out for longer periods and probably get a bit fitter for it. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Smudge, the little terror" class="size-full wp-image-9019 " title="Holding our dumbo rat, Smudge" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/post_3809.jpg" alt="Smudge, the little terror" height="318" %} 

The worst problem we have is with on of the dumbo rats, Smudge. She will let me reach in the cage and pick up to get her out to play, but once loose on the floor she turns into a demon and seeks out and bites my hands. She has bitten Derek a few times, but I am her main target. These are deep bites and she always draws blood. I think it is probably linked to their first owner, who was also female, I guess this is why she targets me more than Derek. We have talked about giving her and her sister, Muffin I don't want to split them up, back to the RSPCA, but I can't bring myself to do it. I made a commitment to the girls when I took them on and I don't have it in my to give up on them. So, I'm going to start giving Smudge lots of attention, even though she pretends she hates it, and squeaks, when I hold her and fuss her. I think she is craving attention and it making her act out. Fingers crossed it will work, because I can't go on with her chomping on my hands at every opportunity.

Apart from a few teething troubles they are lovely girls, most of the time, and I'm glad they are part of our family.
