<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8277" title="Our grey gerbil, Plum sitting in her coconut house" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/post_5836.jpg" alt="Our grey gerbil, Plum sitting in her coconut house" width="470" height="379" />I am very happy to say our brave little girl, Plum is doing okay on her own. She isn't a young gerbil, so we don't see a lot of her, but she her routine of playtime and treats hasn't changed. We always give our little rodents fresh bread at teatime and Plum will often be waiting in her coconut for her yummies. At playtime she comes out for a little runaround which is nice and we get to give her a few sunflowers.

Health wise she has developed a slight rumble in her breathing. We only notice this when she comes out to play, and it doesn't affect her running around, so we aren't worrying to much about it right now. She is getting older and I think a visit to the vet would just upset her more than it would help, with everything she has been through lately.

We are enjoying every precious moment with our little gerbil. She is very brave, not letting the loss of Cherry and Olive get her down and we are more than happy to give her all the attention she wants when she wants it.
