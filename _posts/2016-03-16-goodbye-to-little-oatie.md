More sad news I'm afraid. Little Oatie had been loosing weight for some time. He was still an active little chap, well for the bunch of hermits he and his brothers were, but his weight and dropped quite drastically. At meal times he could still tuck away our human food along with his brothers, but he couldn't put on any weight. This had been going on for quite some time and nothing we tried, not even baby food, could help him gain weight. Then a few weeks ago we noticed he was struggling with his balance and eating rat food was getting tricky for him. While Oatie wasn't keen on being handled by us he had no problem consuming his fair-shareÂ of baby food.

Towards the end I was feeding him babyfood with a syringe, which he seemed to enjoy and I enjoyed being able to hold him and sneak the odd cuddle once his tummy was nice and full. Sadly though it meant that our little guy was slipping away and he died in my hands after enjoying some food and a drink of water.

Saying goodbye to him, especially so close after Pika's death is very difficult, but now we have to worry about Maize who is all on his own. He still not keen on being handled, so is getting no contact wth anyone. I'm making sure to feed him yummy treats and talk to him lots through the day, but I'm aware nothing can make up for the company of his brothers. At the moment he is a big healthy boy, so we are going to keep a very close eye on him and do everything we can to make him feel loved.
