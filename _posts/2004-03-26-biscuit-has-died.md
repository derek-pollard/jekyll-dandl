More bad news I'm afraid just after Christmas we noticed Biscuit had some weakness in his right hand side. He started to become a little clumsy, we took him to the vet who gave him a thorough check over. Unfortunately the diagnosis wasn't good, our vet gave us some antibiotics just in case, but she felt as we did it was probably a tumour. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Our grumpy boy, Biscuit" class="size-full wp-image-6992" title="Our rat, Biscuit hiding in a dark corner" src="/wp-content/uploads/2004/03/post_6175_IMG.jpg" alt="Our rat, Biscuit hiding in a dark corner" height="264" %} 

Brave little Biscuit carried on enjoying the yummy baby food we gave him to keep him strong. Sadly Biscuit began having difficulty eating solid food and we knew it was time and we took our beautiful little Biscuit to the vets and said goodbye.
