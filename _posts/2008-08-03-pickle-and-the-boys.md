Our boy rats seem to have taken over our dinning room! We now have two rat homes in the dinning room and our crazy gerbil, [Berry](/gerbils/berry/ "Berry"), is in there too. Its not a huge room, but somehow we've fitted them in amongst the furniture.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8378" title="The rat cages in our dinning room" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/post_2017.jpg" alt="The rat cages in our dinning room" width="940" height="572" /> 

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8381" title="Our black hooded rat, Pickle" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/post_2276.jpg" alt="Our black hooded rat, Pickle" width="390" height="388" /> Some really good news is that Pickle is happy to run around on the floor while Apple, Bramble and Lime are out. The young ones do tend to climb over Pickle as though he's a giant toy, sometimes peeing on him in the process, but he doesn't seem to care. If anything Pickle seems much more content when he gets put away. And last night he climbed up on Derek to be put away, and then curled up in bed quite happily. Sometimes he can get a bit agitated when its time to go in. Not because he wants to stay out, but I think he's lonely. So maybe having a bit of social contact with other rats did him some good.

It is a shame he can't live with the new arrivals, but they are far too energetic for him. If he managed to fall in that cage on his own, who knows what would happen with those three guys pinging around! The brothers are full of trouble at the moment. It doesn't take much to get them tussling with each other and they clamber around the bars, of their cage, like their monkeys.

We'll keep an eye out for any older guys looking for a home, but until then hopefully seeing the young ones at playtime will keep Pickle happy.
