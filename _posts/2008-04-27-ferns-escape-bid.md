It was a nice sunny morning so we headed out to buy some wire to line the bottom of Fern's run. When we got back we were already to late, Fern had dug a tunnel in her run!

To top if off It's the biggest tunnel she has dug so far. If she had put her mind to it I don't think it would have taken much effort for her to have got out of her run. Fortunately, when we got home she was sitting waiting for us, looking very proud of herself - if a little tired.

It took me ages to put all the soil back down the hole and the lawn still doesn't feel very stable to stand on. We are going to have to reseed the lawn where Fern completely destroyed it. Not that we mind, Fern's safety is always going to be our priority.

While I was filling in Fern's handiwork Derek secured the underside of Fern's run with wire. We hate to stop her being able to dig, but we have to keep her safe while we're not there to watch her and its made a bit of a mess of the lawn too. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="The devastation caused by one sweet little bunny" class="size-full wp-image-6293" title="The mess Fern made digging in her bunny run" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/post_ferntunnel.jpg" alt="The devastation caused by one sweet little bunny" height="258" %}
