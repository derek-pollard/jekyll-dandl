There has been a slight improvement in Apricot's condition; she has breaks in her wheazy breathing in which she looks perfectly fine. It may be wishful thinking, but I am sure the length of the breaks is increasing. Hopefully she will continue to improve. She's not on any medication at all now, it seemed to have no impact on her condition and she was getting a bit fed up of having a syringe stuck in her mouth.

One of my prefered methods of feeding rats Baytril is to mix it in with some baby food, but Apricot must be the first rat I have ever known who doesn't like baby food! I bought some stuff called Nutri-Stat, which apparently a pea sized amount of can sustain an adult rat. She is a bit picky about eating that too, but she will have a bit so that's something. When rats get poorly they can loose weight so easily, before you know it they can feel like skin and bone, so I'm hoping that won't happen to Apricot, she is such a tiny little thing as it is.
