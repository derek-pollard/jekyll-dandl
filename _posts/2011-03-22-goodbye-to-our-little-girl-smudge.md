<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9060" title="Old age Dumbo rat, Smudge out and about" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/post_2286.jpg" alt="Old age Dumbo rat, Smudge out and about" width="390" height="303" />Although Smudge only passed away this morning, both Derek and I feel very peaceful about her passing. It's strange to say but we aren't really grieving for her, we will miss her, but there is no sorrow associated with her death, just calmness.

I guess it's because Smudge was so old. She had been with us for over 2 Years, and she was already fully grown when we got her. So, while we will never know her exact age, she certainly was an old little rat. Since the death of her sisters she had been living a sedate life, choosing to only really interact with us when there was food on offer. She was by no means neglected, Derek and I regularly played with Tula and Tilly, who Smudge shared a home with, but Smudge preferred to stay in her igloo most of the time.

She'd been slowing down steadily over the last month or so. Her fur was looking a little unkempt, and she felt rather frail when I held her. Just over a week ago I noticed she was suffering from slight weakness in her back legs. She was still content and eating and drinking fine, so I didn't worry. Then this morning I found her lying in her cage and it was obvious she was slipping away quietly. I held her until she took her last breath and told her I loved her.

It's nice to know she is at peace and that she died peacefully. Smudge had a difficult start to her life - being given up by her first owner - and it obviously affected her quite badly. I feel very lucky to have been able to give her comfort and security in her life. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Happy times" class="size-full wp-image-9062" title="Compilation of pictures of my crazy rats enjoying a glass of milk" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/banner.jpg" alt="Happy times" height="262" %}
