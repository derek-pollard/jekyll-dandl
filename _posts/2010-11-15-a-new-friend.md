Fern always loved our previous cats, [Treacle and Custard](/cats/treacle-custard/). As they got older both of our boys started to spend more time in the garden, and Fern thought it was wonderful. She loved nothing more than sneaking up on them while they enjoyed a snooze in the garden, or following them around when they did move. Sadly it's been three months since our gorgeous boys passed away, leaving our mischievous bunny without any feline company. Even though we got a [new kitten](/cats/inkie/) she hasn't been allowed outside - until now.

Having no idea how Fern would react to the young, bouncy and rather naughty little cat, we took the first introductions very carefully, with me holding onto Inkie so Fern could get a good look at her. Inkie is only a small cat, not much bigger than Fern, but she does have a wonderful kitty habit of swiping us as we pass. While Fern is more than capable of putting all of us in our place, we didn't want anything negative to happen between the two before they had made friends. I'm pleased to say though that once Fern had got over her curiosity of the newcomer she went back to her bunny business and Inkie being new to the outside world, had exploring to do.
