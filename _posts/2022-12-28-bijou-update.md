Little Bijou has been on her own for a while now but she is doing very well. At first she was understandably confused and upset about where Peanut had gone. I made sure that I maintained her usual routine with the addition of extra checking to make sure she knew she wasn't all alone. She hid away in the downstairs igloo and began stashing all the food in there with her. Her appetite dropped so I started giving her extra treats to help keep her weight up.  {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Bijou looking for her next treat" class="size-full wp-image-10489" title="Bijou looking for her next treat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/post_6902.jpg" alt="Bijou looking for her next treat" height="486" %} 

Bijou has settled down now and appears happier and brighter. We always felt it was important to let our little pets know as best we could that although there had been a change, that their way of life was going to stay the same. She makes more use of both floors of her home and sometimes surprises me as to where I'll find her sleeping. This is one of the reasons I kept her home layout the same even though it is now rather large for a single rat. 

Bijou is doing very well for her age, getting around and responding to my attention. I'm sure the treats help with that. She's friendly and gentle which is amazing for how much loss she has suffered and how she was always one of the more shy girls. I'm very proud of her.
