We are not entirely sure what has happened to our little Almond, but his top teeth are missing! Thursday night is Degu clean out day, so we have our tea on the floor with the gerbils before cleaning out the degu cages. The little gerbils love to help us eat our sandwiches and last night was no exception. We noticed Almond was looking a little scruffy, but he seemed happy and ate plenty of Derek's sandwich, before going back to bed.

The next day I had the boys out and Almond still wasn't looking quite his usual self. I gave him some oats, just to see if he wanted them, and at first he seemed keen, but then I realised he was just dropping them. Oats are like sunflowers with gerbils and very few can resist them, so I knew something was wrong. I picked our little guy up and checked his mouth, only to see he was missing his two top teeth!

When this had happened I didn't know as he had shown no other signs of injury. I let them out everyday, and as they're getting on a bit they don't always venture out or play for very long. It's been fairly warm and apart from Almond looking a bit scruffy, I hadn't seen anything to cause concern. He'd been running around and squabbling with his brothers like every other day.

Still, there was not denying his missing teeth, and my first priority was getting food in him, the poor little guy must have been so hungry. Bread is a favourite of our gerbils and fortunately it is very easy for a toothless gerbil to eat. We have a bread machine at home and bake a fresh loaf everyday, so there will be plenty for Almond to eat.

We are hopeful that Almond just took a silly tumble and lost his teeth that way, rather than a physical problem. Time will tell, but fingers crossed they will grow back soon and our little guy can go back to chomping cardboard and eating his gerbil food.
