The girls are settling in well and finding their confidence. One of the most important things to me is my rats feeling free to come and go from their cage, with supervision, as much as possible. While I make lots of effort to handle them, I believe letting them explore their surroundings helps them find their confidence and that, in turn, makes their bond with me stronger.

All the girls are incredibly inquisitive, though no one has yet had the confidence to leave the cage they are all thinking about it.
