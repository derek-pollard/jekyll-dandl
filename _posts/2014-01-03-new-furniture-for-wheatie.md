If there is one thing gerbils are good at it is chewing, and Wheatie is no exception. I bought him a lovely log cabin when he joined our family, but once he gets chomping through the cardboard we give him his home can start to look a little bare. So I have treated him to some nice wooden furniture for him to get his teeth into. First was his Habba Huts, which are natural half logs, they come in a range of sizes, which makes for a great gerbil environment. For some reason Habba Huts are mainly sold for reptiles, but I always like to treat my gerbils to them, even if I do have to hunt them down in pet shops. Next was a little twig bridge, which forms a nice little tunnel for gerbils to hide in and of course they are also great to chew. Adding logs to Wheatie's home also means that as it fills with chewed cardboard and kicked up sawdust he has little places to hide and tunnel through.

We've only had Wheatie a little while, but he has already settled in really well. He has learnt to leave his cage when we take the lid off and run around on the floor. He's also very good about going back in when he's tired, which is great as he's not easy to catch.

Wheatie may have been an unexpected addition to our family, but he is great and we are both thrilled to be getting to know him.
