One of the main reasons we decided to expand our feline family was Derek's new working from home status. It seems little Pebble agrees it was a good decision. She likes to spend a lot of time helping Derek at his desk, making sure he doesn't overdo it (or forget how cute she is). {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Pebble working hard" class="size-full wp-image-10209" title="Our little kitten, Pebble, sitting on Derek's knee helping with the computer" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/post_pebble-working.jpg" alt="Pebble working hard" height="790" %}
