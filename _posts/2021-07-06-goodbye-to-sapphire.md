Oh dear. It is with a very heavy heart I say that our little Sapphire left us yesterday. For a while now her personality has changed slightly. It was nothing you could really put your finger on, she just seemed a little tense at times, getting upset at me doing things in the cage like changing their litter trays or paper bedding. Little things that she normally liked to help me with, seemed to upset her. Once she even nipped me when I put my hand in the igloo with her, she was wide awake and had dived in there ahead of me. Then at cleaning out time she stood on my foot and bit my ankle until I picked her up. They were strange little things, that were so out of character for Sapphire. At first we thought maybe it was stress because of Topaz's condition. Rats are vey sensitive, and while Topaz is happy and playing, her sisters know she's not well.

Sadly Sapphire's condition started to deteriorate, she began to struggle to eat rat food. As soon as we saw she wasn't eating we fed her some bread and it was obvious something was wrong. Normally when confronted with something yummy all our little rats will grab it and run off, and if you tried to stop them there would be lots of silly squeaking. Not with Sapphire, she was hungry and started eating the bread straight away, but she didn't take it away, instead just laying in my hands and letting me hold it for her. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Sapphire enjoying some bread" class="size-full wp-image-9826" title="Our rat, Sapphire being held and eating bread" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/post_0157.jpg" alt="Sapphire enjoying some bread" height="691" %} 

She was still able to lift herself up and drink from a water bottle, but we decided to get her on baby food to make sure she was getting all the nutrients she needed. Sapphire was very happy to slurp up the yummy warm mixture and for a few days she seemed quite happy. Sadly her strength started to leave her and after one particular feed it was obvious she couldn't be returned to her sisters. Instead she spent the night tucked up in her little rat carrier, snuggled in lots of soft towels. The next morning I checked on her and she seemed very calm, but I couldn't get her to eat anything, so we knew it was the right time to say goodbye.
