Unlike her naughty sister, Topaz, Sapphire did not mess with her stitches at all and the wound has pretty much healed up at super rattie speed. All that is left now is a bald patch and a bit of a rumple on her skin.

We are so very proud of our little girl, she did amazingly well. The bright side of the pandemic is that we didn't have to take Sapphire back to the vet for a checkup. Instead we just got a follow-up phone call to make sure everything had healed up. The hardest part was getting Sapphire to stop wiggling so we could take a picture of her tummy and send it to the vet!

Fingers crossed there will be no more lumps and bumps with our sweet girls, or any of our critters for that matter. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="The Gems looking for treats" class="size-full wp-image-9527" title="My four rats sitting on my knee" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_8229.jpg" alt="The Gems looking for treats" height="574" %}
