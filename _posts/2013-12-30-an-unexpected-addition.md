<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6389" title="Our new gerbil, Wheatie in his Ferplast Duna cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/post_2123.jpg" alt="Our new gerbil, Wheatie in his Ferplast Duna cage" width="390" height="274" />It's bern a while since we've had a gerbil in the house and I have to admit we weren't planning to have any more - Derek and I are getting a little old for sitting on the floor to play with them - but when Derek found this little guy looking for a new family he couldn't refuse. There wasn't much information about little Wheatie, we don't know how old he is, or what his previous family were like with him. He's not a baby gerbil and is quite thin, so he probably hasn't lead the most active of lives, he is also a nervous about being handled.

Before we could bring the little guy home though we had to stock up on gerbil supplies, including a cage. We decided on a Ferplast Mini Duna. Though they are designed for hamsters, we've found they also make great gerbil cages for older or nervous gerbils. Once we were all stocked up, little Wheatie joined our family.

While he's not to keen on being handled, little Wheatie is still a very friendly chap and he seems delighted with his new cardboard filled home.
