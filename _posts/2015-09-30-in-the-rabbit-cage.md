Our little bunny Fern lives in the garden during the day, but at night we bring her in where she is nice and safe. This means that she has an indoor bunny cage that is empty during the day. Once a fortnight we have to leave our bunny's indoor home in our dinning room, which is where Acorn, Almond and Cashew play. I can't lift it on my own, so when I have my little gerbily boys out to play it stays on the floor. The first few times they encountered the cage the boys just ignored it, sometimes running smack into it as they went charging around but mostly they went around it. Then, as their confidence and agility grew, they discovered what was inside and now there is no stopping them. So, every other week the gerbily boys come out of their cage and play in our indoor rabbit cage.

I'm not sure what Fern thinks of what has been going on in her cage during her absence, but I am pretty sure she knows what's been going on. Bunny's know everything!
