Jessie may not be the most active of cats, but she sure knows what she likes... comfort.

We left some old pillows on a cat bed, in what has now become known as Jessie's room, and Jessie wasted no time in making herself comfortable. After some enthusiastic pawing, the pillows are now a little worse for wear, but Jessie doesn't seem to mind. She is one sweet little cat. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="You cosy there?" class="size-full wp-image-9858" title="Our black cat jessie, in a cat bed with two pillows pilled on top of her!" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/post_0175.jpg" alt="You cosy there?" height="802" %}
