  - A new bunny has joined our family. Fern is nothing like we planned for. To begin with she is full of far too much mischief for such a tiny bunny.

Obviously not us and a gorgeous little bunny called Fern has joined our family.

We had decided to get another bunny a few weeks before Fern joined our family. Our intention was to adopt a full size bunny from a rehoming centre, who would live as a house rabbit and be spoiled rotten. We no longer had the run or cages we had for our previous bunnies, so we had to buy a new cage. We headed off to our local pet store, where we found a lovely big cage. There was only one problem, it was so big we couldn't fit it in our car!

There was another problem as well. The pet store we visited had started an adoption centre where they housed and rehomed peoples unwanted pets. They had a beautiful two year old Dutch bunny, called Lucy. She was just what we were looking for, but unfortunately we didn't have a cage for her so we couldn't bring her home with us.

At home I found an online pet store that sold the cage we wanted, so we had it delivered. We went back to get Lucy, but she had been lucky enough to find a new home and Fern had taken her place. I wasn't sure because we had planned to adopt a full size rabbit, and Fern is definitely not a big bunny, but she is agouti (wild bunny coloured). If there is one thing Derek can't resist it is agouti bunnies, and so Fern joined our family.

Fern is ten weeks old and she is small like a dwarf bunny, but she has the biggest ears I have ever seen on any rabbit and what seems like a personality to match. At ten weeks we don't know how much more Fern is going to grow, or if she will ever grow into those ears. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Fern out and about" class="size-full wp-image-6257" title="Baby bunny, Fern exploring her new home" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/post_9470.jpg" alt="Fern out and about" height="451" %}
