I am very sad to say that we had to have our sweet, shy guy Maize put to sleep this morning. Only a few days after Oatie passed away I'd noticed a pea sized lump near Maize's thigh. It was only small and I mentioned it to Derek, so he didn't worry about telling me if he found it. Derek didn't seem surprised at first as he'd been suspicious of a lump, but it was under Maize's tummy. We knew this wasn't good, but with Maize's age (he was pushing three years old) and temperament we knew there was no way we could have him operated on.

We decided just to spoil our sweet boy, while we could, and help him enjoy his final days with us. It was difficult with Maize, because he and his brothers were so shy, it wasn't like we could pick him up and cuddle him. Still we were able to give him one too many yogurt drops and a bit extra of our food at meal times. Maize seemed very happy with the arrangement. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Maize in his favourite trouser leg bed" class="size-full wp-image-7416" title="Our rat Maize, lounging in his denim hammock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/post_0083.jpg" alt="Maize in his favourite trouser leg bed" height="476" %} 

Sadly though, because we don't get to handle Maize at all, he didn't even like coming out to play at clean out time, things moved very quickly and before we knew it the lumps were getting huge and affecting Maize's walking. So we took him straight to the vets and said goodbye.

I feel very peaceful about letting Maize go, being alone and not even playing with us was no life for a little rat. Our vet was incredibly gentle with him, bringing the little container they use to give the rats a bit of gasÂ into the consulting room, so we could pop Maize in it still snuggled in his towels. I don't think he even thought twice about where he was or what was happening. We brought him home and burred him with all his silly shy brothers.
