Not to our girls though. The rubbish that now resides underneath Derek's desk is a world of adventure to Blossom and Maisy. Both girls are wonderfully active and playful, and they love to play with us, each other and whatever toys they can get their little rattie hands on. Alongside their proper rat toys, there is lots of stuff on the floor, from boxes, paper shopping bags and bits of cardboard. The mess provides lots of fun places to hide, climb on, drag around and most importantly chew - hopefully removing the temptation to nibble on our computer wires. We've not always been successful in protecting our things from the rats, particularly Blossom, but I'm sure things would be a lot worse if it wasn't for all the rubbish she has to amuse herself with!
