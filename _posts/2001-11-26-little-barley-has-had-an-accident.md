<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6498" title="Our sweet gerbil, Barley climbing out of her cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2001/11/post_4372.jpg" alt="Our sweet gerbil, Barley climbing out of her cage" width="390" height="271" />Barley jumped from six inches above the ground and fell awkwardly on her face. On checking her over we noticed she had broken one of her teeth.

We took her straight to the vet, we are very lucky that our vet gives small animals the same love and respect as a dog or cat. The tooth is wobbly and out of alignment but Barley is not in pain and is eating, though very carefully. The vet decided to leave the tooth, as to try and remove it would mean an aesthetic. We are to take her back in a couple of days, in the mean time we need to make sure she is still eating and not in any discomfort.

Our fingers are very tightly crossed that beautiful little girl is going to be okay.
