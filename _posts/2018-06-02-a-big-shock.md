I am very sad to say our little Acorn has passed away. We noticed he'd been having trouble chewing over the last few days, and when we checked his teeth were going funny, just like Almond's. As Almond was due for a teeth trim, we booked both boys in to see the vet. Almond has been having his teeth trimmed regularlyÂ for months now with no problems, so we weren't partially worried about taking Acorn along too. Sadly the whole trip and procedure was all too much for our sweet boy Acorn and he passed away at the vets. Our boys are three years old, so they were an old pair, but as always we were not ready to loose our rather cheeky boy. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Little Acorn having a nap after playtime" class="size-full wp-image-8469 " title="Our sweet old gerbil having a sleep" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/post_5906.jpg" alt="Little Acorn" height="504" %} 

It has been a few days now and Almond, while confused at first, is settling down to life on his own. We are making sure to spoil him more than usual. Peeled and broken up pumpkin seeds every night, of course lots of fresh bread and we're saving him broken up bran flakes from the bottom of the packet which he likes in his food bowl to rummage through. Leaving things in the food bowl, was tricky before as Acorn would help himself, and while I'm sure Almond would much rather have his brother back, I think he likes finding little treats to rummage through when no ones around to feed him.
