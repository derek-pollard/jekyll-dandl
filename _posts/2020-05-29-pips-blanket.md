We know how much degus love to snuggle each other at sleepy time. Unfortunately, as much as we'd love to, there is no way Pip and Roo will live tougher happily. Seeing as Pip is such a sweet and cuddly boy, who loves lots of fuss and attention. we've given him his own blanket to cuddle while sleeping.

He seems to like it...
