We've had to make the difficult decision to have our chubby little Mole put to sleep. Just like his two brothers, Ferret and Otter, he had a tumour which was getting quite large in size. It was a very difficult day for us, saying goodbye to him was like saying goodbye to all of his brothers as well.

Mole was such a sweet chubby guy. Back when we first got him he didn't take long to figure out that living with us meant lots of yummy treats. Which he took to mean that our hands were treat dispensers and the little horror would always give us a little nip, before checking to see if there actually was any food on offer. While we'd have preferred he didn't bite us, it was part of who Mole was, a greedy little chap. We are really going to miss him.

Mole and his brothers were a very special bunch of rats especially considering the tough start in life they all had. It took a while for us all to get to know each other properly. Even so, they became a very large and special part of our family. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="My happy boys" class="size-full wp-image-7100" title="Four rats piled on top of each other in their hammock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/post_9043_IMG.jpg" alt="My happy boys" height="524" %}
