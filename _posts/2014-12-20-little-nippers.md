We are having so much fun with our little girls. They are both amazingly confident rats, happy to explore, climb on us and generally get into all kinds of trouble. After only a few days with us they were leaving the office and exploring across the landing in our bedroom. So much so that every night, once our cats are in bed, they have the run of the upstairs while we get ready to turn in for the night. That's something else amazing about them, during the day when we are there to play with them they are more than happy to stay in the office with us, but come night time off they go. Who knows where they are going to end up!

There is only one little problem with our girls, or more specifically Blossom. She nips our feet! Little monster. It started out as a curiosity thing, she was just testing us out, seeing who and what we were, unfortunately she has learnt it gets her attention. Now our cheeky little Blossom nips our feet when she wants something, usually to be put away - silly girl.

Its rather appealing really, she could just go back in her cage, but she prefers to get one of us to pick her up and get a cuddle first.
