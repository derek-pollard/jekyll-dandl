The introductions were relatively simple. Buttercup is a bit on the shy side and was a bit overwhelmed with all the new friends, but once she'd found a nice comfy bed she was happy. As for Bluebell she has the other problem, she annoys the other girls with her endless energy, but we let her out lots and she usually goes exploring on her own.

There are the odd squabbles, but that is just as likely to be between the original four than them and the new girls, so we are not worried. I will keep an extra eye on Buttercup, just because she is so shy. I don't want her to end up forgotten. All thought the girls have a new home with us, and we will never let them down, they have still been through a lot and I've seen how changing owners can affect rats and even if they seem outwardly healthy, its a big shock. For now though everyone seems to be getting to know each other, an I hope it will be good for all the girls to have some new sisters.

From the beginning Bluebell and Buttercup were in the big cage the girls now share, to limit the amount of change they had to experience. This means that Juniper, Jasmine, Lilac and Lily's home has now doubled in size, so they are very excited and a little clumsy as they explore without judging heights and distances. We've had no serious tumbles, but I may have to add more shelves and tunnels if they don't' calm down. The most important feature is lots and lots of cosy beds, well I say that, they all seem to want to sleep in the same one, but hopefully they'll spread themselves out as they settle in.
