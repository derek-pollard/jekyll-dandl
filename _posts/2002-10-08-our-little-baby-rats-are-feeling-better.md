<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6955" title="Two baby rats peeking out of a little cardboard box" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/10/post_5380_IMG.jpg" alt="Two baby rats peeking out of a little cardboard box" width="390" height="346" />We took our new babies to the vets as planned and got them thoroughly checked out. Other than a possible allergic reaction our vet isn't sure what is wrong with them. Our vet has advised us to clear out the rats cage and keep them on paper and try to keep their environment dust free, which we have. She has also given us Baytril just in case they do have some sort of respiratory infection. As well as that she recommended some human medicine, to be given in very small amounts, to try and sooth their nasal passages and make them feel a bit happier.

Biscuits sneezing had started to settle the day after we got him, but Badger is really poorly. He gets very bad sneezing fits and it is quite worrying. If he is eating and starts sneezing he will just drop what he was eating and go back to bed. Because he is feeling poorly and down Badger isn't that keen on exploring at the moment either.

I think Biscuit is the shy one out of the two and he likes to stay hidden in bed, only popping out to grab some food before disappearing with his stash. Badger is slightly more confident, but unfortunately his bouts of sneezing aren't helping him gain his confidence around us.

Of course we are going to love the little guys no matter what and take extra special care of them. Its very difficult to see such sweet tiny little guys having such a tough start in life and not being able to do anything for them. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Our cheeky babies out and about" class="size-full wp-image-6956" title="Tow baby rats exploring a blue plastic filing tray" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/10/post_5403_IMG.jpg" alt="Our cheeky babies out and about" height="542" %}
