We decided to get the bunny cage for Pickle. His welfare is more important to us than anything and I'd be heart broken if he had another fall and really hurt himself. The last fall I was so scared he'd broken his leg, it was such a relief when he started using it again. Hopefully now he'll be safe now.

He doesn't seem particularly fussed about the change. He checked all his beds were there, that his food and water were in the right place, rearranged his bedding a bit before going to bed for the afternoon. And he must have slept well because we had to wake him up at teatime for his bit of bread.
