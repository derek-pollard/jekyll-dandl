<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6970" title="Our agouti hooded rat, Willow leaning off the edge of his cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/11/post_5944_IMG.jpg" alt="Our agouti hooded rat, Willow leaning off the edge of his cage" width="390" height="256" />Little Willow gave us the fright of our lives, we got him out as usual for breakfast, as nothing starts the day better than ratties helping themselves to your breakfast. Willow was very dazed and unresponsive, he also seemed to be breathing heavily. By that night he was no better so we made an appointment for the following day at our vets. The next morning he was a little brighter though we did notice he was limping. Willow is a very excitable little chap and he loves nothing more than charging around and not planning were he is going to land.

We can only assume he had a fall in the night and landed badly. Throughout that day his overall condition improved except for his limp. I still took him to the vets to make sure he hadn't broken any bones. Our vet gave Willow a thorough check over and gave him a clean bill of health apart from the limp. It is just a matter of time to allow Willow's leg to heal and hope he will recover fully. We can only hope he will take a little more care with his antics in future.
