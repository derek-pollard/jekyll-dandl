I am very pleased to say that Apricot is doing much better. She has stopped wheezing and is much more confident, probably because she is feeling so happy. There seem to be no ill effects of being poorly so young, as she is the same size and weight as her sister Peach. So we are feeling very happy.

Our vet has talked to us about an infection called pasturella, which is what he thinks Apricot, and her two brothers who are also ill have. The long term prognosis is not great, as there is no cure. The illness progresses with bouts of respiratory problems that gradually wear the rats down. All we can do is keep an eye on Apricot’s condition, make sure she doesn’t loose any weight, keep her stress free, that kind of thing and see what happens.

For now we are just happy Apricot, and her brothers, seem to be through the worst of their initial illness and are happy being naughty little rats.
