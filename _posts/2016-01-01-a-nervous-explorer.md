After only his third day with us Max is getting the hang of coming out to play. He is still very nervous, but we are taking our time letting him settle and explore his new home at his own pace. Although he still gets a bit nervous once he has left his cage it doesn't stop him coming out every chance he gets.

He has learnt when it's time to go in and after only a few goes at being rounded up (not an easy task as degus are very fast and bright creatures) he is now making it easy on us and will wait in the same spot to be picked up. Hopefully soon we will have taught him to come and go from his cage and then handling him will just be about getting to know each other.
