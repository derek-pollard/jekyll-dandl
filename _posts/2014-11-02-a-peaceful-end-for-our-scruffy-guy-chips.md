Over the past month or so we have seen a general decline in his mobility, not that it stopped Chips getting into all kinds of mischief, but there was no missing the fact he had started dragging himself along when he came out to play. As was the way with Chips nothing stopped him exploring or clambering up into his favourite beds in his home, and he was always the first at the door at dinner time.

He had joined us for dinner today, having his fill of his favourite treat pizza crust before disappearingÂ to bed with his younger brothers. Then about threeish he came down for some rat food, before clambering into one of his downstairs beds and settling down for a nap. I was sitting in the dinning room and didn't hear a peep out of him until Derek went over to see the boys and Chips he saw that Chips had passed. Though we are sad to say goodbye to our wonderful little guy, knowing Chips passed so peacefully is very comforting and suits Chips laid back personality beautifully. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Kapy, Chips and Mango enjoying life and each other" class="size-full wp-image-6446" title="Kapy looking at the camera from his rattie bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/post_0337.jpg" alt="Kapy, Chips and Mango enjoying life and each other" height="440" %}
