<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6765" title="Our little cat, Inkie sitting on my desk" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/post_2233.jpg" alt="Our little cat, Inkie sitting on my desk" width="390" height="520" />Our sweet little InkieÂ was taken ill with a tummy upset at the weekend. It started Sunday morning, she was in the back garden having woken that morning her bright happy self, but just after breakfast we noticed she was being unwell. At first we thought nothing of it, maybe she had a fur ball, but as the day progressed little Inkie got poorlier.

In a vain attempt to help her we popped out and got some furball paste. With it being Sunday we didn't feel it was serious enough to call an emergency vet, but wanted to try something to help her. She wasn't very impressed when we smeared it on her front paws, but she managed to lick it off. By bedtime though it was obvious she didn't have a furball, and she was very ill through the night. First thing Monday morning I took her to the vet and got her some medicine. She was given an injection to stop her vomiting and one to settle her tummy, and while her temperature was a little high, we hoped that was enough.

While the injections had helped settle Inkie's tummy, she was still very glum and not herself. By the end of Tuesday, she still hadn't eaten anything, and while she hadn't been sick since her injection we were still worried for her so took her back to the vets. Our vets are lovely and squeezed us in at the end of the day, so both Derek and I cold take her together. Poor little Inkie was not impressed and cried the whole journey. It was worth all the upset though, as we were given a course of antibiotics for her.

After a little rest I gave Inkie a tablet, she wasn't very pleased, more because she was feeling so poorly rather than not being good a talking tablets. We went to bed still very worried about our little cat. She hid herself away in a quiet corner, as she had been doing since being taken ill, but in the early hours our cheeky little cat made an appearance and jumped on the bed to sleep on me.

Even though Derek and I were tired, after several sleepless nights with our poorly little cat, we were very happy to be woken by Inkie. This morning Inkie looked at her food, she didn't eat anything, but the fact she was interested was an improvement.

She looks so much happier already, and I am confident with lots of TLC our little cat is on the mend. It is also great news to Fern and Cubbie too, they have both been missing Inkie's silly antics. Cubbie especially is very stressed, hardly eating anything himself and hiding away in the garden.
