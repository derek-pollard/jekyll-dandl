We were cleaning Wheatie out today and couldn't resist snapping a picture of his bed. One of the greatest things about gerbils is their ability to chew cardboard into tiny little bits, dig and kick sawdust around and generallyÂ make a mess in their homes, but somehow their beds remain a wonderful little oasis of fluffy nesting material. Amongst the chaos of the rest of their cage, a gerbils bed is spotless, cosy and perfectly formed for super cute gerbil napping. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="'Get away this is mine!'" class="size-full wp-image-6398" title="Wheatie and his fluffy gerbil nest" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/fluffybed.jpg" alt="'Get away this is mine!'" height="290" %}
