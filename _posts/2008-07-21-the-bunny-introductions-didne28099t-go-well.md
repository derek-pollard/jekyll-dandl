<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6619" title="Our bunny Fawn having a lie down" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/post_1200.jpg" alt="Our bunny Fawn having a lie down" width="470" height="270" />Fawn has grown into a happy and confident little bunny, we had him neutered a few weeks ago and he has been vaccinated, so all that was left was to introduce him to our other bunny, Fern. Well, it seemed that simple when we planned it.

Unfortunately Fern and Fawn are not very impressed with each other. There is no real fighting between the pair, but Fawn stomps his feet when Fern goes near him and then runs away, which ends with Fern chasing him and Fawn somehow managing to climb up on my shoulder. It is not fun.

After many failed introductions, which only result in Fawn getting stressed and Fern getting grumpy, we resigned ourselves to the fact we now have two single bunnies. Fortunately Fawn is very happy being a house bunny, in a way that Fern never was. In fact whenever we have tried to introduce him to the outside world he lets us know, in no uncertain terms, that he doesn’t like it!
