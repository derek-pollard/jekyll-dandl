We had been planning to take a little break from rat keeping, but I had to pop into our local pet shop for some bunny food. I admit it I was very naughty and couldn't help peeking at the little rats asleep in the cage. That night I told Derek about the cute little rats, having no idea of official rat colours, nor am I any good at describing colours. Biscuit coloured seemed a perfectly reasonable explanation of the rat. Derek was not so impressed, "What kind of biscuit?" he asked, "Cookie coloured, bourbon, ginger?" Somehow this confusion over what colour the rats were lead to them being named Cookie and Bourbon!

The next morning off we went to look at the baby rats I had seen. They turned out to be two little girls. We were both unsure as I had wanted boys again, I love the big puddings they turn into ;-). We were also unsure about one of the rats looking like one of our previous rats, Pipsie. After much agonising we decided to pop out to another pet shop, where our girls [Pipsie and Chockie](/pipsie-chockie/ "Pipsie & Chockie") had originally come from. They only had two rats, both boys about eight weeks in age, and it was love at first sight. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Biscuit & Badger" class="size-full wp-image-6953" title="Our baby rats, Biscuit and Badger looking out of their cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/10/post_babybiscuitebadger.jpg" alt="Biscuit & Badger" height="342" %} 

Once home we left the little chaps alone to settle in. There was no way Badger could be called Bourbon, he looks like a Badger (to me anyway) and somehow Cookie became Biscuit. Just going to prove that you can't name a little animal before you've met them.

Unfortunately within minutes of being home Badger started sneezing and by the end of the day Biscuit was sneezing too. They had both seemed fine at the pet shop, well they were a little grumpy at being woken up. We will be taking them both to the vets tomorrow and hopefully it is nothing serious.
