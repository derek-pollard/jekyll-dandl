We had just finished tea and were in the kitchen loading the dishwasher when a familiar face appeared at the cat flap, it was Custard!

I admit it took us a few minuets to process the sight of our wayward cat, and once we had we were worried he'd disappearÂ before we'd had a chance to hold him. Rather than go crazy at the sight of him, we stayed calm until he came in, then scooped him up in a big relieved hug. Custard was very pleased to see us too, and loved all the attention he was getting. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Our wayward cat" class="size-full wp-image-6563" title="Our cat, Custard enjoying the garden" src="/wp-content/uploads/2003/09/post0561_IMG.jpg" alt="Our wayward cat" height="464" %} 

Of course he'll never be able to tell us where he was or why, but we are just so happy to see him it is no longer important. We are guessing it was something to do with the unusually hot summer we'd had, he was probably living in the woods behind our home and not thinking about how much we'd miss him.
