<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8228" title="Our gorgeous little grey gerbil, Cashew" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/post_5288.jpg" alt="Our gorgeous little grey gerbil, Cashew" width="390" height="271" />After a short illness I'm very sad to say our little Cashew passed away yesterday. He'd been poorly for a few weeks, slowly getting weaker and losing weight. We'd been feeding him baby food and trying to keep him warm, and he'd seemed happy enough, but we could see he was slipping away. Our gerbils are well over two now, so while we didn't want to lose our little guy, we acknowledged he was a good age and focused more on his quality of life rather than getting him better.

Over the weeks his energy was decreasing as well as his appetite. I was worried he was starting to feel the cold, even with his two cuddly brothers keeping him warm, and I was letting him spend more time in my clothes sharing my body heat with him. It was while he was tucked away in my cardigan that he slipped away peacefully. He'd not long enjoyed some freshly made and warm baby food, so I like to think he was feeling very happy and loved.

Despite his age, and illness we were still shocked to lose him, you always have that hope that they will pull through. Still our Cashew was a brave little boy who stayed with us as long as he could, and we cherished every moment we had with him.

I'm pleased to say his two brothers are coping well his loss. Almond still has no teeth, and Acorn is taking extra special care of his brother. As Almond can't chew, it is now up to Acorn to make their bed nice and fluffy for them both. We do add some nice Safebed to their paper bedding, but anyone with gerbils knows how they love to chew their bedding material and make it as cosy as possible. We are pretty sure Acorn is helping groom Almond too and both boys look in lovely condition. We are very proud of our little guys and are looking forward to many months (if not years) with our boys. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Cashew (right) with his brothers" class="size-full wp-image-8229" title="Our three gerbils siting together enjoying a sunflower treat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/post_E3457.jpg" alt="Cashew (right) with his brothers" height="429" %}
