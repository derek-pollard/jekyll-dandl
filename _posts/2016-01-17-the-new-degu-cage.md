Max has moved into his new cage, and it seems safe to say he loves it. Derek and I had only just finished adding all his toys when he was straight in and playing. He'd played in his cage a few times before, so it wasn't completely new to him, and we used the sawdust from his old cage, rather than fresh, so it all smelled like home. While we were transferring his sawdust, Max got a little upset that some of his stashed degu nuggies had been displaced, and he gave a little warble as he reburied them. Feeling bad for disrupting Max's food, we made sure all his buried nuggies were safely transferred and Derek even reburied them for him.

After a good explore, and a bit of rearranging on our part, Max was happy to come and go from his cage like nothing had changed. All that seemed to matter was his favourite toy, his wheel, was in place, which he thoroughly checked for stability and everything was great in Max's world. His new home has a flying saucer as well as his old round wheel. Many people say the flat flying saucer type exercise wheels are much better for rodents backs, and Max certainly does arch backwards when his running in his round wheel. For now he has both and he can choose which he prefers.

We have spilt the cage into two, top and bottom with some log bridges. These are great for Max as they are safe for him to naw on and they also mean he can't fall the full height of the cage while exploring. So far Max looks very impressed and I'm sure after all his exploring he will sleep very well tonight, if he can decided which of his new beds to sleep in.
