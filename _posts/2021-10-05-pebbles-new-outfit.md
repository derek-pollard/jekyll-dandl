While Pebble's smaller jump suit from the vets did the trick and freed her from a collar, it wasn't as well fitting as the ones Inkie and Jessie had and was a bit fiddly to get in and out of so we ordered one online that a friend had bought for his kitten recently. 

It arrived today and Pebble was much more pleased with her new outfit and it is way more stylish - what a bonus.  {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Pebble ready for action in her new jump suit" class="size-full wp-image-10330" title="Pebble ready for action in her new jump suit" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/post_1579.jpg" alt="Pebble ready for action in her new jump suit" height="747" %}
