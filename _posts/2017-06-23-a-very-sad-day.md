It has been an awful blow for our family as he slipped away so suddenly.

The problem started not even a week ago when Cubbie was poorly in the night. The weather has been unseasonably hot here, and Cubbie has a history with fur balls. We go through this every summer, he's a fluffy boy and because of his shyness is difficult to groom. So after being ill and not being too keen on his food - we thought, 'fur ball'. Like we do every year we got him some fur ball paste and battled to smear it on his paws. Cubbie was not impressed, but he never is when we have to get hold of him.

It was a few days later that Derek spotted Cubbie in the garden frothing at the mouth. It was a really hot day, so I was concerned he was dehydrated. He was still drinking and using the loo, but not eating. In a panic we rushed him straight to the vet. We were scared, but in no way prepared for what was going to happen.

The vet took one look at Cubbie and ordered some blood tests. We waited for the results while Cubbie was looked after by the vetinary staff. We didn't get to see Cubbie again that night, but the vet explained Cubbie had acute kidney failure. His results were completely off the charts, and his prognosis was very poor.

The vet warned us Cubbie could have consumed something he shouldn't, like anti-freeze or even a lily plant. We were sure there was no way Cubbie got near anti-freeze, as he never leaves the garden. Still as soon as we got home we checked our garden for anything harmful, to help Cubbie and keep Inkie safe. After finding nothing, we could only assume Cubbie had some sort of infection that had caused his body to shut down. The only thing we could do was wait and hope, while he was treated in an attempt to help his body start working again.

Sadly despite our vets best efforts, Cubbie's kidneys couldn't recover. Derek and I went to be with him as the vet put him peacefully to sleep. It was horribly painful, but our sweet boy, who could be so shy, did look reassured to see us.

We had always believed that our Cubbie would live a long and secretive life hidden away in our garden, popping out of cover for the odd visit with us, as was his way. Sadly this wasn't meant to be, but he had the life he wanted with his two best friends, Inkie and Fern. There is a large fluffy whole in all our hearts at the moment, but we shall try to remember him with happiness and take comfort in the fun times and love we shared as a family.
