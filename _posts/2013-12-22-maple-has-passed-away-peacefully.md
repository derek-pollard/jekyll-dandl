We had been devoting lots of time to caring for her, keeping her company and making sure she was eating and she seemed happy enough. But today we found her curled up in her favourite hammock looking as peaceful as we could wish for.

We had wanted as long as possible with our little girl, but we are happy that she passed quietly, both for her and ourselves. Loosing Maple's four sisters to illness like we did had been very painful and to know that Maple simply slipped away in her sleep is very comforting.

It's hard to believe Maple had been so terribly poorly as a baby. I still remember her little body laying in my hand as she struggled to breath, but our little fighter pulled through and she blossomed into a beautiful, healthy and happy girl. We were very lucky to have known her and her gentle and patient ways, Derek and I are going to miss her and all her sisters very much.
