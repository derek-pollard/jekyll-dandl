When we were at the pet store yesterday collecting [our little girls Tula and Tilly](/tula-tilly/ "Tula & Tilly"), I caught sight of a beautiful big boy rat. He obviously wasn't a baby and I couldn't resist having a little look at him. There were two other rats in the tank with him, though I only saw their noses peaking out at me. I felt so bad for the big guy, as most people only want baby rats and growing up in a pet store is no life for such an intelligent little critter.

As we were there picking up our new girls there was nothing I could do, and I didn't think Derek would be too impressed if I asked for more rats then and there. So I decided to wait until we were home and our new girls were settled. Not that I needed to worry, as Derek was thinking about the big beautiful boy too.

So, the next day we headed back to the pet store and enquired about the boys. The shop assistant told us that the big rat - who we've called Tiny, because he's so shy and timid - had been with them for 4 months! That just about broke my heart. Panda is pretty much identical to Tiny in both size and markings, with Polar being quite a bit smaller. I'm not really sure what Polar's story is as I was already sold on having all three boys and didn't listen to what the girl said about him! {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Polar (left), Panda (top) & Tiny (right)" class="size-full wp-image-9105" title="My big, cuddly rats, Polar, Panda and Tiny snuggled together in a hammock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/post_polarpandertiny.jpg" alt="Polar (left), Panda (top) & Tiny (right)" height="552" %} 

Once home the boys were thrilled with their new cage, though Panda and Tiny were a little nervous about climbing. Polar is very brave and inquisitive, so I'm sure he'll get his brothers exploring the cage in no time. Rats can't stand by and let someone else have all the fun.
