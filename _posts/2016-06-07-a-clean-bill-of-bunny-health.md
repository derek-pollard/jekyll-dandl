Oh my I am very relieved to report Fern has ben given a clean bill of health. Her course of medicine lasted ten days, and during that time her condition and energy levels improved daily. It was wonderful to watch and we were feeling very positive she was going to make a full recovery, but it wasn't until I gave the vet a sample of Fern's urine that I knew she was 100% better.

I took the sample this morning. Collecting it involved keeping Fern in the house for 24 hours until she finally gave in and used the loo. It wasn't easy and she looked very cross and frustrated, but it was better than leaving her at the vets until she provided one, so I stuck with it and dealt with he angry looks Fern was giving me.

Her illness was caused by a infection and we are very relieved. There was no sign of diabetes in Fern's urine, although we will still be keeping her on her new healthier diet. In that sense this whole incident has been an eye opener as we didn't realise Fern was overweight. Her activity level are very high, running around the garden everyday, she eats lots of fresh grass and hay, and she doesn't eat a lot of rabbit nuggets. I'm guessing it is the bird food combined with her not being quite as active as she was when she was younger. Things have changed so gradually as Fern has aged, but we have learnt a valuable lesson to keep a better eye on her.

Fern is all back to her bossy self, though she has mellowed slightly in that she has let us keep the ramp in her cottage. When she was younger she would just pull it down, over and over again. Derek would fix it back up and Fern would pull it down, until we finally got the message. Now though she is leaving it alone and actually using it.

Our bunny has been tough as old boots in the eight years have known her so it was quite a shock to see her so poorly, but now with the extra special care we are taking of our bun, we hope to enjoy many more years of our crazy, bossy bunny.
