Things are a little difficult with our girls at the moment. Firstly our precious Cherry passed away suddenly on Tuesday. She was looking a little ill on Monday, which was New Years day, her breathing was slightly laboured and she looked tired. We got her straight on the baby food, which she did enjoy and it seemed to help her a bit. Sadly she was very poorly and we found her passed away in her tank on Tuesday afternoon.

We buried out sweet little girl next to her brother, Cashew, in our garden and hoped her two sisters would be okay. Unfortunately this hasn't happened. When I played with Olive and Plum on Wednesday afternoon they seemed tense with each other. Olive was also a little standoffish with me, and she didn't want any sunflowers, I didn't worry about it, because they are sisters and I hoped they would work things out. That evening at feeding time, I found both of them covered in blood. It was was dried and there were no signs of injury, still as gerbils can fight to the death we both thought it best to separate our girls, for their safety. Neither seem very happy on their own, Plum is confused why she's in a different cage and Olive looks so unhappy it is painful to look at her.

Only time will tell if we can reintroduce them. It will be a difficult time, as we, obviously, don't want them to hurt each other, but we don't want to make them miserable with loneliness. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Olive, Plum & Cherry" class="size-full wp-image-8243" title="Our three sweet gerbils together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/page_4531.jpg" alt="Olive, Plum & Cherry" height="509" %}
