When we first decided to go to the RSPCA and find out about adopting a cat, we looked at their website. There were lots of lovely cats of all ages and sizes looking for homes, but one in particular caught our eye. According to the website Mirage was a female, approximately 4 months old, who'd been found in a barn with her sisters. We both thought she looked lovely and couldn't wait to go and meet her.

Visiting the RSPCA shelter several things happened. Firstly Mirage was no longer a cute little 4 month old, having been at the rehoming centre since July and she was a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">boy</span>! We were also caught out by Inkie, when we saw her curled up asleep in the same pen, it was love at first sight. It didn't help that Mirage is a very timid cat, and when we opened the door to the pen he disappeared through a cat flap into the sleeping compartment and we were ambushed by the very cute, cuddly Inkie and she stole our hearts. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignleft" width="390" caption="Cubbie 'mirage' in his new home" class="size-full wp-image-6027" title="Our new tabby cats sitting on Lindsay's knee" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post_1932.jpg" alt="Cubbie 'mirage' in his new home" height="293" %} 

We adopted Inkie, and we love her dearly, but I couldn't stop thinking about Mirage and I felt sure we had room in our hearts and home for another cat. Even though Derek had only wanted to adopt one cat, being the sweet guy he is, he phoned the RSPCA to find out more about Mirage. Unfortunately he was told that Mirage had developed an eye infection and couldn't be adopted until he was better. Not to be deterred, Derek phoned back the following week to find out how Mirage was getting on. Again he was told Mirage was still unwell, but we decided to pop along and visit him anyway. Despite feeling very sorry for himself, wearing one of those awful plastic cone things round his head and weeping eyes, we knew we wanted to adopt Mirage and we made it official with the RSPCA staff.

It took another 10 days for Mirage to be given the all clear and we brought him home yesterday. Derek had originally suggested we call our new arrival Puddin, because he is so soft and timid. I was taken by his huge paws, which reminded me of a tiger cub and so sweet, timid and not very little Mirage became an official member of our family with his new name, Cubbie.
