Today with tears on my eyes I said goodbye to little Bijou. Back in early January I noticed a lump on her tummy and then a second one in early February. Together with her advanced age the second confirmed that it was best not have had her undergo surgery. She has done amazingly well, showing no signs of them troubling her until the last few days. If you looked at her from her right side, you wouldn’t know anything was wrong. Bijou has remained bright, friendly and keen for treats throughout. With her age she gradually slowed down and slept more as you’d expect. Only in the last couple of weeks did she sometimes not wake up and be waiting for her regular treats - she’d still eat them when she did. 

Over the last couple of days her appetite reduced, her mood seemed lower and I was becoming concerned that the first lump was starting to make getting around more difficult. So I made the awful decision to say goodbye to our last little rat. I know that Lindsay would have been thrilled that Bijou reached 3 1/2 years old so as much as I miss her, I will celebrate that fact and know she had a long and love filled life. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Little Bijou having a drink" class="size-full wp-image-10529" title="Little Bijou having a drink" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/post_9048.jpg" alt="Little Bijou having a drink" height="597" %}
