<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6280" title="Our bunny Fern with her injured nose" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/post_9835.jpg" alt="Our bunny Fern with her injured nose" width="390" height="391" />Fern is obviously a bunny who can't help sticking her nose where it doesn't belong. A week ago she managed to pull a bit of fur out just above her nose. It was nothing serious and was only noticeable when we were close to her.

Fern is a very active little bunny and she does like to throughly explore the garden. While we weren't worried about Fern's injury, we were keeping an eye out for any places she could have hurt herself to stop her doing it again. Unfortunately Fern managed to hurt her nose again, before we found where she had done it. This time her injury is more serious. Not only has she managed to pull out more fur, but she's lost some skin too and has a very nasty looking scab. We think she has hurt herself by going up the side of the house and sticking her nose under the gate. She cannot get out of the garden this way, but obviously being such an active and inquisitive bunny she is trying to get as good a look as she can at the world outside our garden.

We have blocked off the side of the house completely, so she can't get down there at all. Lets hope Fern doesn't find anywhere else to stick her nose.
