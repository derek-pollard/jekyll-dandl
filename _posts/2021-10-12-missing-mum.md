Lindsay passed away suddenly and everyone is heartbroken.

### Inkie's entry:

I am very confused. My super best friend Cubbie left suddenly a few years ago, then my garden friend Fern became poorly last year and now mum has gone. I don't know what to think other than I hope dad doesn't go as well.

Mum was the best. She was always joining me in the garden and if it rained she brought an umbrella to keep me dry. Mum's knee was very comfy and she always made room for me and gave me fuss even when she was eating her tea. She was always pleased to see me. I miss her everywhere.
