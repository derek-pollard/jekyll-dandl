We're all having a rough time coping with the loss of Cubbie, especially little Inkie. It started with her crying a bit more than usual and getting quite upset when she thought it was feeding time, even if there was food in her bowl. Then we noticed her fur wasn't looking quite right, and we knew she was really struggling. We plugged in a Feliway diffuser and our little Inkie was feeling, and looking, better after only a few hours. Obviously we know it's not going to be that easy for our little cat, she loved Cubbie dearly, but we hope with love, time and the extra boost of the Feliway, she will learn to cope without her beautiful big brother.

Our bunny, Fern seems to okay with the sudden loss of Cubbie. She was very close to him as well, seeing as Cubbie never left the garden he was always nearby for our bunny and we would often catch them hanging out together. With Fern heading towards her tenth birthday, and living in the garden by herself, I had always taken comfort in the thought Cubbie would always be there for her. Sadly this wasn't meant to be, and we will be keeping an extra close eye on both his little friends to make sure they adjust to life without him as smoothly as possible.

It is still hard to accept he is not hidden away somewhere in the garden, and although his gentle soul will live on in our hearts, we are all going to miss him everyday for many years to come. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Cubbie, Inkie and Fern" class="size-full wp-image-7925 " title="Our two cats and bunny hanging in the garden" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/post_4485.jpg" alt="Cubbie, Inkie and Fern" height="647" %}
