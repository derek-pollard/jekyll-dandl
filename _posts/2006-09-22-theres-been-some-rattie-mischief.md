Oh dear, after only a month we have had our first casualty of our little ratties and their mischief. You would think after ten years of living with rats and all their naughtiness we'd know better, but apparently not. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Naughty Toffee with Derek's phone" class="size-full wp-image-7602" title="Our baby rat, Toffee with his paws on Derek's mobile phone" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/post_8278.jpg" alt="Naughty Toffee with Derek's phone" height="419" %} 

We normally let Toffee & Caramel run around on our desks. I know this is probably not the best of ideas, as it gives them access to all those lovely wires and expensive computer equipment. But, having them up on our desks means we can play with them and don't have to worry about them getting underfoot on the floor, while they are so tiny. Up until now we have been pretty lucky, I guess with them being so young they are still happy to explore. I have caught them trying to make off with a couple of things they've found. Nothing serious just a small Post-it note and a rubber, but nothing terrible has happened. That is until now...

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7603" title="A USB stick with the a chewed cap" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/09/post_8268.jpg" alt="A USB stick with the a chewed cap" width="390" height="344" /> 

Derek was backing up his computer onto a data stick and he left the little, tempting, plastic cap of it sitting out in the open on his desk, while the rats were out. I had warned him about the perils of leaving plastic items around for the ratties to find, but he obviously forgot the advice until it was too late and the said item had mysteriously disappearedÂ from his desk.

While Derek searched his desk and the floor for the missing object, I had a look in the rats cage and there it was. Sadly the little plastic cap is barely recognisable and is definitely no longer fit for its purpose, though more importantly our rats are okay after their non recommended change in diet.

Lets hope that Derek has learned his lesson and is little more careful with yummy pieces of plastic.
