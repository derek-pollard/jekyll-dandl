Sadly I have had to say goodbye to Opal & Ruby. Both girls previously already had lumps removed earlier in the year and been enjoying life since, even after losing their two sisters. Unfortunately they both had a new lump form and although this has not caused them upset they had reached the size where it was beginning to affect their mobility and would become an issue. They were both quite old and it was amazing how they had coped and adapted to getting around; remaining happy, responsive and always pleased to see me.

It was truly heartbreaking to say goodbye to both of them at the same time. They were such sweet gentle girls and all I wanted to do was bring them back home from the vets alive. I knew that while they would have been alright that day and maybe even for a few more days, it wouldn't be right for them and it was better say goodbye with them happy and comfortable together.

Even though they weren't the most outgoing rats they were wonderful members of our family and I will miss them and their sisters very dearly. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Ruby and Opal enjoying some fresh bread" class="size-full wp-image-10431" title="Ruby and Opal" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/post_8094.jpg" alt="Ruby and Opal enjoying some fresh bread" height="579" %}
