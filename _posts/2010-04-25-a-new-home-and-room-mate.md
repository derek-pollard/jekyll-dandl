Tula and Tilly are settling in well. They are as happy, adventurous and boisterous as you would expect two little rats to be, which is why we decided to give them a new home.

The girls were living in a Savic Freddy cage, which is great for young rats as it has quite small bar spacing. It is, however, quite a dull cage, as it has very dark coloured bars and with only one door, which gives poor access. I have a lovely airy Ferplast Furet Plus, that is slightly bigger, has fantastic access and lovely green bars. There is only one snag, the cage is already occupied.

Smudge is the remaining rat of a group of [five female rats](/kiwi-sugar-pearl-smudge-muffin/) I adopted from the RSPCA, she is quite old and hermity, choosing to spend her time in her igloo. It seemed mean to move Smudge out of her home - even if she doesn't use it - so, I decided to move Tula and Tilly in with Smudge.

Things have gone really well, Smudge has put the girls in their place a few times, but I think the girls are enjoying their new big cage so much they don't really care. I think having Smudge around has helped Tula and Tilly gain confidence outside of the cage as well. While the girls were very bave and playful inside their home, they weren't always that sure about coming out to play on the floor. So, when Smudge does leave the cage - she's a bit old and doesn't appreciate a lot of excercise - she helps encourage Tula and Tilly to leave. That's one great thing about rats, they can't sit by and watch another rat have all the fun and cuddles.

We've caught the three girls curled up together a few times in the week they have been together, which is lovely to see. Most of the time though Smudge hangs around in her igloo, while Tula and Tilly get to play and explore in the rest of the cage. I think the move has been a big sucess for everyone.
