This morning we woke up to a wonderful blanket of snow covering the ground. Here are some of the photographs we took while walking around our local area:

<img class="size-full wp-image-3039 alignnone" title="The snowy view from the end of the road we live on" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_0921.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />  
This first picture is of the end of our road; to the left is a sports field that borders on open fields. It was all very picturesque and dramatic with the sun breaking though the clouds.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3040" title="A big old tree covered in snow" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_0923.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="666" />  
This big old tree looked stunning covered in snow. As you can see some cars had already  
(bravely) made their way through the snow.

The car park to the sports filed has not been used, all the disruption to the snow was from children playing and dragging sledges.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3032" title="A park near where we live, covered in snow" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_0918.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />  
A park area in the centre of our village, we didn't stop and sit on the bench.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3035" title="Early morning and sun is shining through some clouds above snow covered trees" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_0920.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />  
Another dramatic picture, with the sun breaking though the clouds.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3031" title="An icy road" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/img_0917.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" />  
You can see how icy the roads got quite early on in the day. We didn't risk taking our car out, it stayed safely locked up in the garage.
