Our crazy little hermit girl Lily was put to sleep this morning. It wasn't a great shock to us as she had a tumour on her side, still as funny as she was we are sorry to see her go. Because of Lily's age, her slightly reclusive personality, and the fact she was alone, we had decided not to put her through surgery. We had been taking extra special care of her, as far as she would let us. Since being on her own, Lily preferred not to come out to play. That didn't stop me opening her cage door and trying to tempt her with treats. While she would snatch the treats off me, nothing I did could convince her to come out. Even at cleaning out time, she'd be back in her cage before it was fully put back together. As soon as her favourite blue igloo was in place she'd be in it. Then when cleaning out was finished she wandered round to make sure everything was right, before heading back to bed.

As much as I loved these funny little routines with Lily, her lump got to a point where it was impacting her life. She was struggling to scratch with her back foot and although she didn't move around much, it was getting in her way. It was hard to take her to the vet, but thinking of her being at peace and remembering her with her sisters does give some comfort.

Derek and I had a lot of fun with our mixed bag of girls, whether they were running riot around our home office or chomping loudly when we were trying to make a phone call, our girls were a big part of our lives. We will miss them all, and always remember how they would all try to squish themselves in one bed together. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Our girls doing what they loved to do, sleeping" class="size-full wp-image-8753" title="Silly pictures of our silly rats squished up in bed together " src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/jasminejuniperlilylilac.jpg" alt="Our girls doing what they loved to do, sleeping" height="292" %}
