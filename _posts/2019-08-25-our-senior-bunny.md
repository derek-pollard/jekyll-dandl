We are finally facing the fact our super bossy bunny, Fern, is now a senior rabbit. At twelve years old our vet officially declared Fern's status at her annual check up. Over the past few years we have seen Fern slow down, not in the amount she gets up to just the speed. She is still as bossy as ever, making sure we know when she's ready to go in and challenging our authority when we try and get her to do something. There are still many times we have to leave her out in the garden while we leave the house because she just won't budge or be found.

One thing we have noticed this year is weakness in Fern's front legs. Again nothing to stop her getting about, but you can see signs of weakness when she gets up from a good rest. As arthritis is common in rabbits, we have started her on Metacam to help with any pain she may be experiencing. While at her check up, our vet took some blood just to make sure Fern is otherwise healthy as Metacam can cause problems with kidney function. There was no need to worry though and her results came back impressively healthy for both kidney and liver function. So, we know she is fine to have a daily dose of Metacam, which will hopefully make her feel a bit more comfortable. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Fern and her best friend Inkie, relaxing" class="size-full wp-image-9250" title="Our bunny, Fern relaxing in the garden with Inkie, the cat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/post_6832.jpg" alt="Fern and her best friend Inkie, relaxing" height="641" %} 

Fern's teeth are still looking nice and healthy, she has a few spurs but nothing to worry about. Obviously her love of chomping sticks and twigs has done her well over the years. Derek and I can't really take much credit for Fern's diet as she eats whatever she wants in the garden. Obviously we do our best not to introduce any plants to the garden that would be harmful to Fern, but other than that she eats everything and anything. Including our beautiful wild flowers that she ate to extinction!

To ensure Fern's continued good health, we are getting the new rabbit haemorrhagic disease type 2 vaccine for our little bunny. I admit I was quite shocked to hear there was a new strain. We chose to have Fern's routine vaccinations first, which were due, rather than get her started on the new vaccination. Though we will get her vaccinated as soon as we are able, as there is a two week wait between jabs.

We are also experiencing a spike in heat here in the UK and temperatures are pushing 30 degrees Celsius. As we have recently had air-conditioning installed in our home we are able to bring Fern in during the middle of the day to giver her some relief from the heat. Surprisingly she seems to appreciate it.

We are still enjoying our crazy rabbit's company and we hope this journey carries on for a long time to come.
