It's a chilly start to December as far as the bunnies are concerned. Though we've not had much snow fall, nor are expecting much more, Mars and Jupiter are not impressed. They have never been ones for the cold, much preferring to come in early than be out in the cold and today was no exception.

After a brief explore of the snow covered garden, our boys soon made it clear they wanted in. Sitting near us on the patio they both made a big show of pulling snow out from between their toes and looking as unimpressed as possible. Derek and I had no choice but to obey our little bunnies and we brought them in where it was warm and dry.
