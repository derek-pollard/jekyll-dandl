While Topaz is coping very well with her two lumps, which are sadly getting quite large, we also found a lump on our chunky girl, Opal. To be honest I had hoped she would get by without any lumps, but sadly not. We found a lump growing on her hip, and despite her age I wanted to get it removed.

Her operation was this morning and I'm pleased to say she came through the whole process very well. As with her sisters Opal was groggy and unresponsive at the vets, but as soon as I got her home she was wide awake and wanting to be with her sisters. Once in her cage, she had a huge drink and then started eating. So we are quite sure she is going to be fine.

Opal has pain relief for the next few days, just to keep her comfortable. She looks very happy to be home with her family and I'm hopeful she is going to make a speedy recovery.
