Petal has been living with Daisy, Peach and Apricot for a few days now and all seems to be going well. I had noticed Petal was sleeping on the cage floor rather than an igloo or the other beds. I'm not sure if it's the heat, or if Petal finds it a bit crowded all of a sudden, so I've put an extra igloo in there for her. I'm sure Derek will tell me I'm fussing when he finds out, but Petal is my princess and I want her to be as happy as possible.

I had worried that Petal would find Peach and Apricot a bit annoying. Well, Peach in particular as she loves to go pinging around the cage. But Petal is amazingly patient with her and of course there is rattie etiquette that I couldn't possibly understand. If Peach does go bouncing into Petal, she'll do something, that I can't see, and Peach stops dead in her tracks, turns round and bounces off the other way!

It's also wonderful to see them cuddled up with Petal. It has been hard seeing Petal on her own in that big cage. And now, having only known the girls a few short days, she just looks so content. Makes me feel all warm inside :-)
