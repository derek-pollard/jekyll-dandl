My sweet little Twix has passed away. He'd been poorly for about a week and had stopped eating and drinking. We were feeding him babyfood, which he seemed to enjoy, but he was very confused and wobbly. After talking to our vet we decided after everything Twix had been through it was best for us to say goodbye and let him be in peace.

The journey we have been on with Twix, from the large scary chap he was when he joined our family, to the cuddly frail guy he became has been incredible. And though we hope we never come across another rat who has been as badly treated as Twix was, we are glad for everyday we got to spend with him and for how much we came to love him.
