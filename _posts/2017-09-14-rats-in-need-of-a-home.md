As I've said before our local pet store has a little section where they offer animals for rehoming. We try to avoid looking, but it is right next to the sawdust and rodent food, so it can be hard not to take a peek. It was four weeks ago when we first noticed these three girls huddled up in one of the tanks. Actually it was Sage's gorgeous nose that I spotted, with her white stripe who could resist seeing who it belonged to. As lovely as the girls looked, we had six rats at home, along with everyone else, and didn't think we'd have the time to offer more rats a fulfilling home. So, it seemed the best thing to leave them and let someone else adopt them and give them the time and attention they deserved.

Week after week we'd pop in for supplies, and see the girls waiting, after a month we couldn't take it anymore. As well cared for as the animals are at the pet store, nothing could beat a real home, even if it was already a bit overrun with rodents. During the adoption process we were told the rats were very nervous and did have a tendency to bite, probably why they were still waiting for a home. It wasn't the best news, but once we'd made up our minds we couldn't go back, so home they have come.

They are all still quite young, and apparently, Sundew is Ivy's mum. Sage is a black hooded rat, with a lovely white stripe running up her nose, Sundew is a husky and little Ivy is beige hooded, and they all look very healthy if a little stressed at all the change. If we are lucky we can introduce them to our other six girls and they can live together in our office, for now though they tucked away in one of our old rat cages and enjoying a bit of peace and a nice fluffy bed.
