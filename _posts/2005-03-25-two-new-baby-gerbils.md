After the amazing experience of [Barley and her sisters](/barley-syrup-millie-rogue/), we had decided to take a break from gerbils. We had done very well sticking to our resolution until we popped into our local pet shop for some supplies. No trip to the pet store would be complete without a little look at the baby animals, what harm can it do? There was a sign on one of the animal tanks that read 'Male gerbils, six months old. Please ask a member of staff', so we did. Their original owner had found them a handful, anyone who knows happy, healthy gerbils will understand what they meant, so they had returned them to the pet shop, which is far better that leaving them in a corner and ignoring them. We were given the gerbils for free, which made them even harder to refuse.

So we brought the latest members of our family home. They were a little overwhelmed at first, not having had any cardboard at the pet shop, they were kept very busy when confronted by a home full of things for them to destroy.

We no longer had our Ferplast Duna cage that we had previously kept our gerbils in, so we had to keep the guys in a travel tank (it was still bigger than what they were in at the pet shop). As luck would have it we had to go to Ipswich a few days after getting the gerbils. We knew that there was a Seapets superstore there and that they stocked the Hagen Zoozone cages, and at a very reasonable price. So we popped in and bought our gerbils their new home. We got home and let Cheddar and Chive out on the landing while we made up their new cage and filled it with all the wooden toys and logs, we had kept from our last family of gerbils, oh yes and lots of cardboard. The guys did not take much encouragement they both jumped in the new cage and started tunnelling and chomping the cardboard. We did not see very much of Cheddar and Chive the next day, so they must of had a good night playing and exploring in their new home. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Chive" class="size-full wp-image-6470" title="Our new gerbil, Chive leaning out of his cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/post_4931.jpg" alt="Chive" height="344" %} 

They are both wonderful active and inquisitive little guys and have made themselves right at home running around our house and making a mess as they shell sunflowers and pumpkin seeds. Not that we mind, it is wonderful to have the pitter patter of tiny gerbil feet filling our home again.
