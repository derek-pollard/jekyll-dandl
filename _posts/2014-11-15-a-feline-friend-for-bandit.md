[Our cat, Inkie](/inkie/) has always been fascinated by our rats, and for Bandit the feeling has been mutual. Since the sudden loss of his brother I have been spending a lot of time with Bandit sitting on my knee and the door to the office open to cats. As Bandit hasn't been interested in wandering off I wasn't worried about him getting hurt so saw no harm in letting our two silly cats near him and I was right. As soon as she came in the room Inkie could tell Bandit was on my knee and she crept up to us with wide eyes, jumping up on my desk to get a better look. Rather than being afraid Bandit was very interested in the visitor and he climbed up on the desk to be with her, which Inkie was not very impressed with at all.

Since that first encounter Bandit has been more and more interested in Inkie, something Inkie is not to sure about - Bandit is a little rodent after all. Between the two of them they seem to have struck up a very odd friendship, with Bandit following Inkie around the house and me following Bandit trying to keep him safe.

Whatever is going on between the two of them, as long as Bandit is safe I'm just thrilled to see him having some fun and running around.
