Sweet PomPom suddenly took ill yesterday and had to be rushed to the vets. She had lost a fair bit of blood and was quite weak. Without doing a scan, which may not have been conclusive, the vets could not tell if PomPom had a tumour or an infection. With one it would be best to say goodbye to PomPom and with the other antibiotics could be tried. In all other ways PomPom was happy and healthy so I wanted to give her a chance. She is now on painkillers and antibiotics and seems to be recovering her strength. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="PomPom having some fresh bread after her medicine" class="size-full wp-image-10415" title="PomPom having some fresh bread after her medicine" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/post_8045.jpg" alt="PomPom having some fresh bread after her medicine" height="585" %}
