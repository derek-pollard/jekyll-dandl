It seems like a long time ago now, but it was only a few months that we discovered two small lumps on both the girls. They were both quite small and soft, so we were weren't unduly worried, until after only two weeks Blossom's lump was huge. We have never seen a tumour on our rats grow so quickly, and were very shocked how it had gotten away from us. It is best to get lumps removed while they are as small as possible, but this had grown from a small soft fatty lump into a large hard ball.

We took Blossom straight to the vet and got her booked in for an operation the very next day. Everything went smoothly for our little rat, although we were shocked to discover the lump was a fifth of Blossom's body weight! Blossom was allowed home the same day, but because her lump was on her right thigh, we had to try to keep her as immobile as possible. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Blossom and Maisy reunited after Blossom's surgery" class="size-full wp-image-7390" title="Our rats cuddled up in their yellow bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/post_3336.jpg" alt="Blossom and Maisy reunited after Blossom's surgery" height="575" %} 

It was only the day after her surgery the strain on Blossom's wound was starting to show. Blossom is a very slim rat, and she had lost some surrounding tissue from the tumour being removed. This combined with the location of her wound, the fact it is impossible to keep a rat immobile and she wouldn't stop playing with them, Blossom's stitches were struggling to hold. And after a very difficult weekend we had to take Blossom back to the vet to have her wound stitched back up.

Our vet is a lovely lady and she tried a different technique of stitching Blossom's wound. We were also given some bandages and tape, not to dress Blossom's wound but to try and distract her from playing with it. Sadly this still didn't work and by the end of the week Blossom had a horrible, smelly and slightly damp open wound. We took her to the vet first thing Saturday morning, just to get her checked out and make sure she'd done no more damage than was visible. As expected there was nothing more to be done surgically for Blossom and we were faced with the prospect of letting the wound heal on its own. With how fidgety and naughty Blossom is, we are expecting the wound to take two weeks to heal. I'm not normally a squeamish person, but the thought of Blossom having a smelly, damp hole in her side for two weeks is not something we are looking forward to.

For those of you who are interested, and have a strong stomach, you can find a photograph of [Blossom's open wound here](/blossoms-open-wound/). **Please be warned though it is rather disgusting**.

Blossom is on a course of Baytril, to help fight infection and Metacam to give her pain relief. All we can do now is wait and make sure she takes her medicine. I would also like to say we are keeping her calm and still, but we are not - Blossom is running around everywhere like nothing is wrong, it is terrifying!
