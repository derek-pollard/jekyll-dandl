I'm a bit concerned that it seemed to come up very quickly. Derek and I often role both Pepper and Pippin onto their backs and tickle their tummies. They squirm about a pretend they don't like it, but they never try and get away. Anyway I thought I noticed something a week ago, but when I looked properly I couldn't find anything. Pippin is quite a squishy rat and the lump moves quite freely, so if it was still fairly small that may be why I didn't find it.

We took him to the vet this morning and he has been booked in for surgery next Monday. Normally we get to book operations for the next day, but for some reason they are really busy this week, so we will have to wait. There is no urgency for him to have the surgery, but I would feel better if it was just done and out of the way.

Poor little Pippin was exhausted when we brought him home from his appointment. I've said before that he and Pepper are very soft guys. They have lead such a safe and cosy life, that a trip to the vet is very upsetting for them. He's having a good sleep right now, so hopefully he'll feel better when he wakes up.
