When we woke up on Sunday morning we were horrified to find he was showing the same symptoms that his brother, Flower had suffered from. To see our active little guy struggling with his balance broke our hearts. Thumper had shown absolutely no symptoms before and to find him struggling desperately to stay on our feet was a terrible shock.

At first we were just numb, but we knew Thumper needed help so we rushed him to the vets who confirmed our worst fears. It was obvious there was no choice for us, as we could not let our beautiful bunny suffer, so we let our vet put him to sleep.

It was a terrible shock, even after the loss of Flower we had hoped Thumper would fill our home with his antics for many years to come. Since he has gone our house just isn't the same, and we have made the difficult decision not to have any more bunnies for awhile. We miss you Thumper.
