My five new girls are all happily living in their princess palace together. As soon as we felt Maple was well enough we moved her and Kiki in with Dora, Tangy and Mitzi and once all the intial excitement was over watched them all settle down happily together.

It was a nice and simple introduction. We were cleaning the big cage out, and Maple and Kiki really wanted to come out and play, so we let them. Of course once out they made a bee line for the big cage which was down on the floor! They played happily in the wire top while I changed the hammocks, and tried to wipe the shelves, with them trying to help and pinch the cloth all the time. By the time the cage was clean and put back together, all the girls were pooped and we just left them all together to sleep. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Rattie happiness" class="size-full wp-image-10015" title="My five rattie girls snuggled in their hammock together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/post_3290.jpg" alt="Rattie happiness" height="301" %} 

Derek and I kept a close eye on the girls just incase they woke up and realised what had happened, but I'm pleased to say there was no trouble at all. The girls have been sharing the cage for a few days now and they all look very happy and content.
