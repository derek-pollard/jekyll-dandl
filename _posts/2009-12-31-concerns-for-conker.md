He's a really lovely boy, though he did develop one naughty habit of nipping Derek's feet while he was out playing. We were really starting to enjoy our new guys, even with the sad loss of Apple and Lime, Chestnut and Conker were very sweet and entertaining.

Sadly a few weeks ago we noticed a change in Conker, he suddenly stopped climbing and eating and he had become wobbly on his feet. We dug out the baby food and started feeding him, while he was a bit clumsy eating it, he still managed to tuck it away.

Conker's condition has improved slightly, though he can't manage to eat solids and seems to have problems coordinating his front paws. When he washes he tends to roll over, and he has a very short attention span and is easily distracted, which can be a problem when we are feeding him. Despite all this he seems really happy, I don't think he is suffering in any way, mentally or physically, he is just a bit clumsy and confused.

Chestnut is still doing well. He has a strange respiratory problem, which he's had since we got him, he can get a bit out of breath when he gets excited. We've tried him on Baytril, which had no effect, but as with Conker he is bright and happy. We are keeping a close eye on him to make sure his condition doesn't deteriorate. Both boys, and Bramble, seem to be enjoying all the baby food and attention they are getting. So, for now, if they are happy then so are Derek and I.
