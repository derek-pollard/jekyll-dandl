A couple of weeks ago she started acting a bit strangely, we'd not seen much of her at play time, but she was always sure to turn up at treat time! We didn't think too much of it as she was drinking and eating and looked happy and healthy, then she appeared to have some sort of fit. I wanted to take her to the vet, but she wouldn't let me near her. The girls have a very big cage, with lots of places to hide, and if I did get near Tangy she got very agitated, so I decided to leave her alone. The next day she seemed fine, a little weak, but she was happy to be held and was eating and drinking fine, so we wanted to see how she went on.

Tangy went from strength to strength over the following weeks, she still wasn't that keen to come out and play, but all the girls can be like that from time-to-time. Then a couple of days ago she started to look quite thin and tired. Her appetite had tapered off slightly, though she'd eat the odd treat. We started her on Baytril, just in case, and kept her hydrated with sweetened water that she liked to drink out of our hands.

Then sadly today, after enjoying a nice red grape, she came to her cage door. I immediately picked her out and gave her a cuddle and within minutes she had passed away. Despite her illness it was still a shock, I really wasn't ready to say goodbye. Though Tangy has gone, it feels good to know I was there for her. Rats are amazing creatures, so loving and sensitive, it really means a lot to me that Tangy made the effort to go to her cage door and get my attention. I'm going to miss her very much, and I'm going to take extra special care of her sisters for her, and maybe spoil them a little bit more.
