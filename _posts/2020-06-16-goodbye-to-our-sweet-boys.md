Moomin has had his teeth problems for going on eight months now and while his top teeth never grew back properly he didn't let it get in the way of his love of life. We had to regularly take him to the vet to file his teeth, which he did not enjoy, but Moomin seemed to treat it as a minor blip in his otherwise very happy, gerbily life. Unfortunately a few months ago we noticed a hardened lump on Moomin's scent glad. There was little we could do for our chubby guy, with his age and teeth troubles we thought it best to just look after him and let him enjoy his life for as long as he could.

The lump on Moomin's tummy was getting bigger, though he wasn't letting it get him down, or stop him getting about. We, however were starting to worry about Sunny. He loved us, we knew that, but he loved Moomin so much more. If we had to make the decision to have Moomin put to sleep we were concerned the impact that would have on Sunny.

He'd been his bright happy self the day before, trying to steal Moomin's bread and eating all the broken sunflower bits meant for Moomin, but suddenly he was very still and quiet. He was still warm to hold, but didn't show any interest when we held him, normally Sunny was a wiggly little bundle who was more interested in food than us. Not even Moomin could get much of a response our of him, not that he tried much. It was like Moomin knew that little Sunny was leaving us and sure enough Sunny passed away peacefully the next day. We were very sad to lose our little guy, but at the same time there was comfort in his passing. Moomin's lump was starting to get very big and it was bleeding if he knocked it. As much as we loved Moomin we knew we were nearing the point where we would have to let him go.

As always we wanted our gerbils with us forever, but that could never be. So, losing Sunny so peacefully we were able to take Moomin to the vet the next day and say goodbye to him before he started to really struggle. Knowing our boys wouldn't have to cope without each other brought us a lot of comfort.

Sadly we are still in this pandemic, with restricted services, which meant we weren't able to be with Moomin at the end. Instead we sat in our car while the vet took care of him. That was hard, but we know letting him go was the right decision. Once home we able to bury our little boys together in the garden and say goodbye to them both knowing they will always be together. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Sunny & Moomin" class="size-full wp-image-9482" title="Our sweet gerbil brothers, Sunny and Moomin" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/post_7956.jpg" alt="Sunny & Moomin" height="575" %}
