Oh dear, our sweet girl Buttercup is very poorly. It started with a lump underneath her left eye. We were hoping it was a simple abscess and, because of its location, took her straight to the vet. Our vet wasn't unduly worried and agreed it was probably an abscess caused by infection the root of a tooth. As Buttercup is obviously quite old, this seemed the most logical diagnosis.

The plan for the surgery was to drain the abscess and clean out any infection. Unfortunately during during her surgery the vet found that Buttercup's jaw bone had been eaten away, either by infection or more scarily a tumour. Knowing how much we love our little rats, our vet did everything she could to clean Buttercup's jaw and bring her back to us.

The operation has left Buttercup with an open wound on her jaw, to let the infection drain. We have lots of medicine for our little girl, including pain relief, and will of course need to clean her cheek daily.

I won't say it will be easy, but while Buttercup is happy and bright we are going to do everything we can to get our little girl through this. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Cuddles with Buttercup" class="size-full wp-image-8748" title="Our sweet old rat buttercup enjoying a yogurt drop" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/post_0080.jpg" alt="Cuddles with Buttercup" height="585" %}
