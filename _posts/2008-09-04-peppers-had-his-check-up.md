What a big baby he was, he squeaked when we put him in the pet carrier, wriggled and squirmed for the vet. Then the big baby squeaked when we put him back in his cage with Pippin.

I don’t blame him really; having an operation is a big deal for anyone especially a little animal who doesn’t understand what’s going on. It’s funny, he is such a large rat and both he and Pippin are such softies.

Its pretty safe to say we are all glad its over and Pepper is okay and he can go back to being a big cuddly baby.
