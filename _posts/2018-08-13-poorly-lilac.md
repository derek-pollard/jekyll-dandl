We've been having a difficult time with our little critters and I'm sorry to say things are not looking up. Our sweet little girl, Lilac is very poorly. We had a very hot July here in the UK and none of the rats have been very happy, but we noticed Lilac was looking a little more lethargic than the others and her breathing was a bit heavy. We took Lilac straight to the vet and got her some medicine.

Being so tired and breathless she was a little reluctant to eat and has lost some weight. I've been treating her to Yogurt Drops, Lilac loves them, and although they are not the healthiest food they are better than nothing. While she's still eating a lot of yoggie drops, Lilac is now managing to eat a bit of rat food and some fresh bread at teatime.

There is no denying Lilac is very poorly, but she is holding on and we are going to do everything we can to help her get better. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Lilac and her sister, Buttercup snuggled together" class="size-full wp-image-8555" title="Two of our rats snuggled up in a fleecy bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/post_61751.jpg" alt="Lilac and her sister, Buttercup snuggled together" height="542" %}
