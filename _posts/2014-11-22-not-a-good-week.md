I don't even know where to begin with this update, other than to just say both of my 'Choclateers', Whisper and Truffle have passed away within a week of each other.

Little Whisper has always been a slightly snuffly boy, this combined with his terrible shyness always made him seem a bit sickly, but he was a happy little guy and had no problems getting about. After the peaceful death of our old guy Chips I'd been keeping a close eye on Whisper, the two of them had been very close with Whisper often following Chips around and sleeping next to him. I was concerned Whisper was loosing a bit of weight, when you don't get to handle your rats it can be hard to tell, but I'd been making sure he got lots of human food and he was eating that with no hesitation. Then on Wednesday the 12th I heard him start to snuffle quite badly and he became very agitated, charging round his cage. Worried he was going to fall down the ramp in their cage, I picked him out. The poor little guy didn't even care, he started frothing at the mouth and gasping for breath and before I could figure out what to do he'd passed. It was a horrible shock, regardless of the sudden death of my gorgeous boy Wombat, I really thought Whisper was doing okay.

Then yesterday the same thing happened with Whisper's brother, Truffle. I'm still not even sure what happened, I mean Truffle had always been so healthy. He was a good stocky boy, who was one of the more active and adventurousÂ of the gang. But within minutes of getting into difficulties he'd died in my hands.

All I can say is we buried them together in the garden and I am going to pay extra close attention to their three remaining bothers to make sure they live long and happy lives.
