First off I'm pleased to say there has been some slight improvement in Apricot's condition. She is still wheezy, but it has been more off than on today. Yesterday we noticed her sister, Peach, sounded a bit rough, but that seems to have stopped. Fingers crossed it will stay that way. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Apricot with her sister, Peach" class="size-full wp-image-8783 " title="Our two rats, Apricot and Peach" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/post_2609.jpg" alt="Apricot with her sister, Peach" height="518" %} 

On the down side one of Apricot's brothers, Lime, has started wheezing. This has really confused us, because they don't even live in the same room. We had to take one of our other rats, Pepper, to the vet yesterday to have some stitches removed and we asked about the breathing problems. The vet said it was unlikely we could have transferred anything between the two rats, especially as they live in separate rooms, which is what we thought. We collected extra Baytril for Lime - just in case - and we are keeping a close eye on the rest of the guys.

Our vet did mention asthma. If we see no improvement in either Apricot or Lime, we'll be heading back to the vets to find out more about asthma in rats and how to treat it.
