We thought it was a slight respiratory infection and didn't worry about it too much. His brother Whisper has always been a bit snuffly and its just one of those things, so we thought it would be the same with Chewie. We took him straight to the vet to got him checked out and our vet wasn't to concerned either, so he was put on a course of Baytril. We had to go back just over a week later for a followup appointment, Chewie hadn't improved much but we still weren't too concerned. Our vet gave us some more medicine and we left. Chewie had got a little upset during his trip to the vet, but few little animals like being bundled up in a pet carrier and taken away from home, but once he knew he was home again he dived into his cage and went to bed seeming fine.

That afternoonÂ Derek and I were sitting in the dining room when Chewie started getting agitated in his cage. I went straight to him, and he obviously wanted to come out so I put him down on the floor. Within minutes his condition had deteriorated and I could see he was barely able to breath. I picked him up and held him to me, which was something Chewie had never let me do before. Then before we could even discuss calling the vet Chewie passed away.

We are still in shock and have no really idea what happened. The other boys seem fine, so we can only hope that what happened to Chewie isn't something that will affect them, either physically or emotionally.
