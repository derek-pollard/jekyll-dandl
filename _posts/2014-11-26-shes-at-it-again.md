Digging that is. Oh goodness me, will Fern ever stop?

Our cute little bunny is seven now, and I admit she has calmed down a lot, but will she ever stop destroying the garden? We have always believed bunnies need the freedom to run free, be that in the house or garden and this has never been more true for Fern. I don't even mind her digging tunnels, its just where she does it. This time she has been digging under our two pyracantha plants, which she also loves to eat, and shredding some nice ground covering plants in the process. Not to do things by halves, Fern is also having a good go at chomping her way through an old bit of tree trunk above her tunnel. When not digging she is stripping the bark off that for good measure. Who knows where our little bunny thinks she is going.

After a few days of letting her destroy, I mean dig, I had to put a stop to her fun. Filling in her tunnel with what soil I could salvage, before topping it off with fallen leaves. My handy work seems to have done the trick and Fern has moved on to other endeavours. Fingers crossed that's the end of her digging for this year.
