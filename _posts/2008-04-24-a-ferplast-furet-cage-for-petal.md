<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7653" title="post_0901Petal showing off her new Ferplast Furet cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/post_0901.jpg" alt="post_0901Petal showing off her new Ferplast Furet cage" width="470" height="425" />Now Petal has recovered from her operation, we thought it only right that we should get on and sort out a new home for her. We chose the Ferplast Furet, after reading rat cage reviews on the Fancy Rat website. It was a little bigger than we had room for in our living room, which is where we wanted Petal to live as she was on her own, but when it comes to rats you can't scrimp on space, so rather than get her a home that was too small, we made room for her large new home.

Poor little Petal didn't quite know what to make of all the extra space at first, and even though her wounds from her operation were healing well she was probably still a bit sore. Not that it took her long to pluck up the courage to explore every inch of her new home, and as her strength and confidence build she is starting to make the most of all the extra space, inside and outside her home.

Though the addition of Petal to our family was completely unexpected, she has quickly become a very important member of our family. Considering everything she has been through in a very short space of time she is a very special little rat and we are looking forward to getting to know her even better. Who knows maybe we will even be lucky enough to find her some sisters to share that huge cage with, watch this space...
