At just over a year in age, Sapphire like her sister is still very young, though I'm happy to report Topaz is still healthy and happy after her surgery.

There is never a good time for our little critters to be poorly, but when you are barely able to leave the house for any reason it is pretty much the worst. We weren't sure what to expect with getting Sapphire treated, and I'm sorry to say it was much worse than we thought.

On discovering Sapphire's lump the first thing we did was call the vet. We knew they were closed for vaccinations and general appointments, but we thought this tumour would be an emergency. Sadly we were wrong. Unless the animals condition was immediately life threatening it was not an emergency. Now we knew that if the lump got too big, it couldn't be removed, but it wasn't going to kill her. It was devastating news and I was too shocked to think about it. Fortunately Derek managed to keep a level head and he just kept sending photos of the lump to our vets. The lump was increasing in size quite quickly, and thank goodness, after just over a week we got a call from our vets asking us to bring Sapphire in for surgery.

The day of the surgery we weren't able to have a consultation with the vet, instead having to sit out in our car until a nurse came out to collect Sapphire. Taking little animals for surgery is difficult at the best of times, but that was hard, still we were so relieved to actually have the operation. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Letting Sapphire explore our car before her surgery" class="size-full wp-image-9511" title="Our little rat Sapphire exploring our car" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_8337.jpg" alt="Letting Sapphire explore our car before her surgery" height="424" %} 

We were back at the vet that afternoon sitting in our car waiting for Sapphire to be returned to us. It was such a relief to have our sleepy little girl back. We brought her straight home and returned her to her sisters. Sapphire wasn't too interested in company, and hid herself away in their plastic igloo and her sisters left her alone.

It didn't take long for Sapphire to sleep off her anaesthetic and the next day we found her cuddled up with her sisters in a nice fluffy bed. It was lovely to see, she is still obviously quite sore but she looks very happy to be home.
