Twix is really starting to mellow and it's great. He can stay out of his cage longer now, and will happily pop back in for a drink and something to eat before coming back out again. We leave him alone while he is out now, so he can wander around and do his own thing and generally enjoy his freedom. We do still go and see him. He likes chasing us around, especially up and down the stairs. His walk and flexibility has improved a lot he no longer hobbles around and he can run now too. He is pretty nifty at getting up and down the stairs as well. It is wonderful to see, he is like a new rat.

We have moved his cage into our dining room as well, so he gets to spend more time with us, and I think that has helped a lot. When we first go him he would get quite agitated if we hung around near his cage to long, so we kept him in a spare bedroom. We could go and say hello, but we could leave him alone when he started to get stressed.

Now he's in the dining room we get to share our dinner with him which is great for him and us. It's hard to believe we are now able to put our hands near him without worrying that he's going to chomp our fingers, but he takes his food from us really gently. He is such a sweet guy.

The other great breakthrough we've had is being able to touch Twix, while holding him in the towel he lets me stroke him behind his ears. He still gets cross if I hold him too long, but the fact that I can touch him at all is enough for me.
