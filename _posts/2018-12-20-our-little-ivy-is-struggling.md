<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8739" title="Our sweet rat, ivy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/post_6351.jpg" alt="Our sweet rat, ivy" width="390" height="311" />After making such an amazing recovery from her surgery just a few months ago, I am really scared to say precious little Ivy is unwell again. I honestly don't know what to think, a hole has opened underneath her left eye. This is nothing like what happened with [our other rat, Buttercup](/juniper-jasmine-lilac-lily/#post-8607), this is something different but just as scary. Our vet is positive, and given us medicine to help her, but we are terrified.

Of course we will do everything we can to help Ivy and get her through this difficult time. She is the youngest of our three girls, possibly even Sundew's daughter. Ivy has the sweetest personality and to see her unwell again is heartbreaking.

With adopted rats, you always have this need to make up for the heartbreak of losing their first families. No matter how bright and outgoing they are you always see it affected them, and while it isn't our fault it still hurts to know they have been hurt. To see Ivy suffer physical on top of everything she has been through is too much. Still she is far too young to give up on, so we will fight to get her through this and fingers crossed enjoy many more years with our sweet girl.
