There is no sign of Almond's teeth regrowing, so we have added baby food to his diet. It is important Almond get all the nutrients he can, and seeing as baby food is yummy and helps little humans and rats, grown big and strong, it should help our little gerbil get better. He has taken to it very well, but then so have his brothers! We are having to battle Acorn and Cashew as, while we love them dearly, they will turn into giant monster, overweight gerbils if we let them stuff themselves on baby food.
