The four boys have settled in so well together that we have treated them to a fancy new rat cage. It is an Imac cage and the same as the one our other rattie boys live in, except this one has a tunnel that comes out of the top.

Otter was the first one to discover the tunnel. I think because Mole, Mouse and Ferret grew up in a pet shop and never knew anything besides the glass tanks they keep them in, they never learned to climb much. Otter has no such troubles and he was straight up there. Ferret has taken a bit of a shine to Otter and he follows him around a lot, not that Otter seems to mind too much, anyway he has followed Otter into the overhead tube. They are a funny pair, if one is already up there they have a shoving match if the other comes up. It looks like they are trying to stop the other one getting up, but I don't think they are because once they have squeaked and shoved a bit they'll both go right to sleep squashed up together.

There is also more room in this cage for me to hang beds and tunnels, without it becoming so cramped, so Mole and Mouse have some nice new places to sleep too. I think all the extra space is going to be good for the guys, Mole and Mouse still aren't the best climbers, but they are trying and I've tried to make everything easy to get to so hopefully they won't have any falls.

The four guys are such sweet little chaps. It's not nice to think about the tough start in life they all had, but I am so glad they are ours now. I really hope we make them as happy as they make us.
