Where no Jessie has gone before.

Bless her, Jessie is such a banana, but she has, at last, made it down the garden. It has only happened once, most of her rare adventures outside end at the corner of the house, but now we know she can go further when the mood takes her.

I admit I really didn't like it when she wasn't going out at all. It seemed wrong to me, not that I would force her outside. Still I feel much happier now she'll pop out, even if it is only for a few minutes. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Degu watching" class="size-full wp-image-8315" title="Jessie sitting on a chair under our dining room table" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/post_5825.jpg" alt="Degu watching" height="366" %} 

Jessie is nothing like I imagined having a cat to be, but she does make us laugh every single day. Honestly I'm not sure what, if anything, goes on in her head, but the things she gets up to. Whether she is hiding degu toys under the rugs or dragging her pom-poms round the house, Jessie always looks content with her little life. Well except when she thinks we are late at feeding time, then she can turn into a bit of a monster, but it's still funny.

She is so good with all of our other little critters, and her big sister Inkie. Jessie loves to sit with us at degu playtime, and she is very good getting up on a chair and not bothering the boys. We don't let her near the gerbils at playtime and she mostly accepts this. Sometimes she plays up and tries poking her paws under doors, but usually she waits patiently for us to let her in. The rats aren't that keen on Jessie, so we shut her away for her own protection :-).

Life with a self imposed house cat is a lot of fun and we are looking forward to watching Jessie grow and waiting to see if she ever gets used to life outdoors.
