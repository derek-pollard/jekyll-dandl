I am thrilled to confirm our lovely new boys are full of fun and adventure. At first the boys were a bit unsure about leaving their cage and it took a bit of encouragement to get them to leave, even then when they did they'd get into a bit of a panic if I moved and would run back to their cage. I'm not sure if it was because of the pet shop, where they received lot of love and handling, but obviously weren't allowed to wander off. Not that it matters, the boys are full of adventure now and it's wonderful.

Their cage set up allows them to come and go as they please, without their cage having to be put on the floor. It's good fun and exercise for them, as they have a tunnel and a series of shelves to negotiate to reach the floor. Derek and I work from home so the guy can come and help us as and when they want, and they do. Messing with computers and wires always seems to be a favourite rattie past-time and these guys are carrying on the tradition. Bandit is the worst culprit, he's terrible for getting into everything. Luckily neither of the boys seem to be chewers so, fingers crossed, our wires are safe!

Our office is so alive and full of mischief it makes for a brilliant working environment, though you do have to do a rattie check before you leave your desk, don't want anyone getting squashed. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="This seat is taken" class="size-full wp-image-6362" title="Bandit and Wombat peeking our from an office chair" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/post_2296.jpg" alt="This seat is taken" height="329" %}
