Having not long goodbye to Caramel, Minty's condition started to deteriorate. Because Minty came from a homing centre we were never sure of his exact age, but we always thought he was a very old chap. He was also extremely thin when we got him and, not through lack of trying, he never managed to gain much weight. We started to notice that he was getting very unsteady on his feet and he seemed to be having difficulty eating normal rat food. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Caramel and Minty on a rare excursion out of their cage" class="size-full wp-image-7630" title="Our rats, Caramel and Minty" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/post_0100.jpg" alt="Caramel and Minty on a rare excursion out of their cage" height="443" %} 

All ratties love baby food and Minty was no exception, even in his weakened state he enjoyed being hand fed large amounts of baby food. Unfortunately this was not enough to sustain him, as he had also stopped drinking. It became obvious to us that Minty was getting very confused and was not comfortable. So again we made the difficult decision to say goodbye to one of our little rattie friends, and took Minty to the vet to be put to sleep.

Toffee has handled the loss of his two brothers very bravely and he is enjoying extra attention, and food, from us. He is such a cuddly little chap and while we know we can never make up for proper rattie companionship, we are certainly doing our best.
