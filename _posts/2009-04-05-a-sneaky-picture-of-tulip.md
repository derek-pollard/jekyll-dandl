We finally got a photo of our shy little rat. Here's little Tulip in bed with two of her sisters, Muffin and Smudge. She's not very impressed with the intrusion, but its playtime so they're all getting up anyway. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Little Tulip" class="size-full wp-image-8457" title="Our shy little rat, Tulip inked with two of her rattie sisters" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/post_4383.jpg" alt="Little Tulip" height="562" %} 

She is much more relaxed in the presence of other rats and we're hopeful she'll want to get to know us a bit more now.
