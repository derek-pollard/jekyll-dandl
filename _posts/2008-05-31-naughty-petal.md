Oh that rat! She has decided to start nibbling the base of her new cage. There is a lip that runs around the bottom of the cage and it is obviously a nice chewing height, and Petal has had a good nibble of of all the corners. While she hasn't broken through the base yet, we are going to have to keep an eye on what she gets up to, because we don't want any midnight escape attempts!

Petal's other vice is chewing the bars! We think this is because she's on her own, and no matter how much time we spend with her, or how much we love her, nothing can make up for not having the company of other rats. So, we think this behavior is due to loneliness and maybe boredom. While we don't hold what she's doing against her it is scraping all the lovely green paint of the bars of her new cage and will probably shorten the life of the cage. I know this would have happened in any cage, but it is annoying. Having said that how can you be cross with a little rat who when you hold her up to your face to tell her off and she licks your nose?

One things for sure Petal is a handful. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Butter wouldn't melt" class="size-full wp-image-7656" title="Out little rat sitting no the door of her cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/post_0914.jpg" alt="Butter wouldn't melt" height="307" %}
