We had planned to let Fern out in the garden next summer, when the weather warmed up, but Fern had other ideas. Being a house bunny wasn't exciting enough for her. It started off with her climbing on our bed, then progressed to climbing on the furniture in our bedroom where she discovered our house plants and started digging them up.

So we have given in and bought Fern an outdoor run. We had really wanted to build her something ourselves, but the weather was too cold and Fern obviously was not going to wait. Our chosen bunny run is actually a chicken coop, but it works just as well for a bunny home. It is not as big as we would have liked, but it does have an all important bunny door, so Fern can run free around our garden and hopefully burn off some of her energy.

Depending on the temperature Fern spends at least two hours a day in the garden. We always sit with her when she is out of her run, so she can charge around the garden safely and of course so she's not lonely. Most of the plants are loosing their leaves, making the garden look very drab, not that Fern is bothered. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Fern's new bunny cottage" class="size-full wp-image-6274" title="Our new outdoor bunny run" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/post_9730.jpg" alt="Fern's new bunny cottage" height="398" %} 

She learned really quickly to go back into her run when we clap to let her know it's time to be put away and sometimes she even goes in and sits there looking at us, as if saying 'come on shut the door.' Looking at Fern outside having fun, it's hard to believe we ever thought she could be a house rabbit.
