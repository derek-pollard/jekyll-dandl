We've been responsible cat parents and had our little Jessie spayed. It was not an easy day being without our little cat, but we know how important it is for her health and wellbeing. Come mid afternoon we picked up a very groggy little girl who could barely stay the right way up, never mind walk. She was in such a state, we left her shut in her cat box, in her room to recover a bit more. Sure enough after a hour for so nap Jessie was feeling much better and appreciated some cuddle time.

As we had such a difficult time with Inkie, who ripped her plastic collar off as soon as we got her home, we opted to get Jessie a little post-surgery cat suit straight away and save her from the clumsiness of a plastic collar. Neither are ideal for a little cat, but I feel the suits make it easier for cats to get around, sleep more comfortably and still wash the bits of them that are accessible. As Jessie is such a cuddly little cat, the suit made it easier for her to be with us and snuggle.

Jessie was so great about wearing her suit, she lasted the full ten-days before her stitches were due to be removed, Inkie sulked the whole time and was a terrible pest. As cute as she looked we were so happy when the suit came off and we had our super cute little black cat back. it will take some time for her fur to grow back, but we are just happy not to have our kitten in silly clothes, and of course she can wash herself properly again, which she did for quite a while. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Doesn't she look cute?" class="size-full wp-image-8117" title="Our little black kitten wearing her red post-surgery cat suit" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/post_5029.jpg" alt="Doesn't she look cute?" height="629" %}
