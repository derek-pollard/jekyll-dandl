<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9094" title="Our sweet old age rat, Tilly, enjoying a cuddle" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/post_0106.jpg" alt="Our sweet old age rat, Tilly, enjoying a cuddle" width="390" height="331" />I'm very sad to say our beautiful little rat, Tilly, has passed away. Her two tumours were very slow growing, and we have had a wonderful 10 months caring for our precious little girl. Sadly though we noticed that Tilly was starting to struggle, her energy levels were dropping and we were concerned that her lumps were starting to affect her mobility. So, we made the difficult decision to have her put to sleep.

It was a terrible decision for us to make, but ultimately our priority is Tilly's quality of life and we had to do what was best for her. Derek and I love our little girl so much, and she was so brave and at peace as we took her to the vet to say goodbye, we are able to take some comfort that she slipped away peacefully.

We will always remember our precious little girls together, getting into mischief and stealing treats. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="My beautiful girls" class="size-full wp-image-9092" title="Our beautiful rats, Tula & Tilly, out and about" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/post_banner.jpg" alt="Our beautiful rats, Tula & Tilly, out and about" height="356" %}
