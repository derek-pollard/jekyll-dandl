It is very hard to accept but our little Wheatie has passed away. In the year we have known him he was an active, brave and fun loving little chap, but sadly his time with us has come to an end.

A couple of months ago we noticed he'd stopped chewing his cardboard, he was still quite active in his cage, but just not chomping his way through every last bit like he normally did. He was still making his fluffy little paper beds, but they weren't quite as well made as normal either. Then we realised he'd not been coming out to play much. It was near then end of summer and we'd put it down to the heat, as he was still attentive and eating. We tried not to worry, as he was still happy and alert.

About a week ago, Wheat's appetite started to drop off, he wasn't terribly interested in his morning bran flakes or his favourite treat of fresh bread, which was a worry. Then two days ago, on Saturday, we came to clean his cage out and Wheatie was having problems with his back legs. He could sit fine, but when he tried to run his legs extended fully and he ended up charging around with his bottom in the air. As the weekend progressed the problem got worse, as he moved around his cage he was finding it difficult to control his movements and to stop when he wanted to. By Monday he was barely getting out of bed, and when he did he really struggled to get around. So with very heavy hearts we took our sweet little gerbil to the vets and said goodbye.

It's been a very difficult day, but Wheatie was always such a joy to know. Even in the short year we had him, he reminded us what fun gerbils are and how you are never to old to sit on the floor and play with a little rodent.
