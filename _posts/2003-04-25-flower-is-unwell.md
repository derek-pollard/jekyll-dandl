It started one afternoon when I found Flower under the bed. He was lying on his side and appeared unable to get up. I picked Flower up and cuddled him for a while, although he seemed fine once I had picked him up he had given me quite a scare. As Flower seemed happy, we did not take him straight to the vets, though that night he had several more turns. Next morning we took him straight to the vet who listened very carefully to Flowers symptoms and tested his reflexes. Our sweet little bunny was very groggy and his reflexes where quite poor. The vet gave Flower an injection and asked us to bring him back the next day. That night Flower had several seizures. We were getting very scared not only was it very distressing to see our bunny so helpless, but we were also getting up several times a night to take care of him.

On our second visit to the vet we were given some medication. While this helped to control his seizures we had to increase the dose a couple of times to get him sorted out. Flower is a very brave little bunny and we are very proud of how he is coping with everything he has been through. Having his medicine twice a day cannot be much fun, but this has not stopped his bright and cheeky ways. While we will probably never find out what caused Flower to begin having seizures, we are hopeful that they won't prevent him enjoying a happy and mischievous life.
