Shockingly our gentle giant Mouse has passed away. It was a terrible shock for us, I came home from work lunch time and found him on the floor of the cage.

It was a terrible day for our family, we had no real warnings that anything was wrong. Looking back he had stopped climbing as much, choosing to sleep on the floor of the cage rather than up in his hammock. But all the rats had got to that age were they were a little less active, so Mouse's behaviour did not seem odd.

When we first got the rats Mouse was a little intimidating he would just come charing at our hands and we were a little nervous of his intentions. Then as we got to know him we realised he was jsut incredibly affectionate and only wanted attention.

We are going to miss him very much, he was the most affectionate out of the four boys and we had formed a very close bond with him. He had a very happy life enjoying lots of cuddles and treats and we will always love him. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Our sweet boy, Mouse" class="size-full wp-image-7089" title="Our sweet rat, mouse being stroked by Derek" src="/wp-content/uploads/2004/07/post_7886_IMG.jpg" alt="Our sweet boy, Mouse" height="552" %}
