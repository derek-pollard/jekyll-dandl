After Tiny's death and Panda being so upset, we had been spoiling the boys with a lot of extra treats, nothing naughty mind; bran flakes, a bit of our dinner and some fresh bread. They had been loving it, but about a week ago I noticed Polar's eating was slowing down. His appetite was still the same, but he was taking longer to get through his food, and his fur was starting to look a little scruffy, in every other way he was fine. The boys are getting on a bit, and they were never big fans of running around at the best of times so his activity level didn't noticably change. Even so, we knew our little guy wasn't okay.

All we could do was keep on spoiling them and keep an eye out for any problems. Then yesterday at tea time I was in the kitchen, Derek and I had just given the boys some bread, which they had both taken happily, I heard a slight rustle of paper. I went in to check on the boys, and Polar had passed away. Although we weren't with Polar, we can take comfort in the fact that we had just been with him, and that he'd been enjoying one of his favourite treats, yummy freshly baked bread.
