We've had a very sad start to the year as our beautiful baby Carmel had to be put to sleep. He started out with symptoms that looked like a respiratory infection and we got him some medicine from the vets. Sadly the very next day he started bleeding from his nose, which was very distressing for all of us. We rushed him straight back to the vets. Of course with little animals there is very little they can do by way of examination, and though our vet said there were some treatments they could try to help Caramel, if it was something serious, like a tumour, then he would only deteriorate.

It was a very difficult decision for us, because Caramel was by no means old, but he was feeling very poorly. We both found it very hard to say goodbye to him, but in our hearts we knew it was the right thing to do. Caramel was far too beautiful and precious to us to be made to suffer on the off chance he might recover. It was a horrible shock to loose him so quickly, but we will always love him as our big cuddly ginger boy.
