Usually when I name my rats they end up with names that go together, at least in my head. With these boys the naming process all got a bit muddled up, with them arriving in two separate groups. As they are three pairs of brothers, I ended up pairing each name to their sibling, which lead to them all getting nicknames.

## The Pikachus

First to arrive was Pika. His name came from my love of video games and in particular Pokemon. Many years ago I had a Nintendo 64 game called 'Hey You Pikachu, it was one of the most annoying games I have ever played, you actually had to talk via a microphone to Pikachu. The little yellow rodent never listened to me he'd just tip his head to one side and say 'Pika'. Although Pika the rat is not yellow, and I hope he's not going to be anywhere near as naughty as Pikachu, he does for some reason remind me of the bright yellow mouse.

When Chewie arrived it seems right to name him after another Pokemon, but I admit some of their names like Tepig or Mudkip may sound a little odd. As Derek wasn't too impressed with my Pokemon related suggestions - maybe you have to enjoy Pokemon to appreciate them - I turned my attention back to the name Pikcachu. Chu just didn't sound right, neither did Chuchu, but Chewie was perfect. And the pair of them have became known as the Pickachus for short.

## The Granolas

It was Maize who arrived first of this pair, with his ginger hood he made me think of wheat fields. His colouring didn't quite lend itself to the name Wheat - which was a good thing as a [little gerbil](/pets/gerbils/wheatie/) came along and took that name just a few days later - but I thought Maize suited him perfectly.

When his brother Oatie arrived I followed the crop theme. Oat alone didn't sound right, so he became Oatie. These two are almost identical and with them being so secretive, we're not entirely sure who is who, so they became lovingly known as the Granolas. Derek and I will usually say 'one of the granolas' because by the time we've figured out which one it is they've usually stopped what they were doing and gone back to bed, or worse go in a tizzy because we were staring at them.

## The Choclateers

Finally we have the Choclateers. Now it was Truffle who joined our family first, but he still had no name by the time his brother arrived, and it was little Whisper who got his name first. There were several things that struck me about Whisper, one he seems very timid, even more so than the other guys. There was just a look in his eye that said please leave me alone. On top of that he reminded me of my previous gorgeous rat, Willow. With his lovely brown hood, shy nature and with Willow in mind, the name Whisper suited him perfectly.

Our black hooded rat, Truffle is not named after a fungus, I was thinking more of a chocolate truffle when I named him. Although little Whisper was named more for his personality than the chocolate bar, we do have a family joke about black hooded rats being large of bottom,. So, when it came to naming Whisper's brother we thought it would be fun to go with the chocolaty theme. It was with this in mind that we then started calling them the Choclateers.

So there you have it, and if I ever refer to my boys by their nicknames you'll know who I'm talking about.
