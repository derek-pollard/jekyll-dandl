My very first rat, [Crunchie](/pets/rats/crunchie/), was an Agouti rat – a natural brown rattie – and a little while ago I made a joke to Derek how I was going to have three agouti boys and call them Crunchie, Crunchie and Crunchie! Well you know they say, be careful what you wish for… {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Our new girls exploring their home" class="size-full wp-image-6733" title="Our new agouti rats" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/post_2945.jpg" alt="Our new girls exploring their home" height="222" %} 

I was wandering around the Internet one day – when I was supposed to be working – and happened upon a local breeders website that had some Agouti babies for sale. Unable to resist I got in touch and found she was just down the road from me, and had exactly three little Agouti babies left – it was meant to be!

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6734" title="Two of our baby agouti rats sitting on a shelf in their new home" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/post_2987.jpg" alt="Two of our baby agouti rats sitting on a shelf in their new home" width="390" height="249" /> Our new arrivals are super cute little girls, not boys, and they are absolutely beautiful. Obviously I have not named them all Crunchie either. These little girls have been named after characters from one of my favourite Nintendo games, Animal Crossing. In the game Dora is a cute little mouse and Tangy and Mitzi are funny cats and seeing as they have been some of my favourite villagers over the years I thought I would name my rats after them.

The little ones are being a bit shy at the moment, so Derek and I are winning them over with some yummy treats. We have some exciting things in store for our new little rats, including a fancy new cage. They are in a Savic Freddy at the moment, and while it is a great cage, my girls deserve better and bigger! More about that when they move into their new home.

For now we are letting the girls take their time and settle in, though I can’t wait to play with them and let them run riot in our home office.
