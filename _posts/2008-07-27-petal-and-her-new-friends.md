We recently adopted [three young rats from the RSPCA](/daisy-peach-apricot/). They are a young mum, Daisy, and her two daughters, Peach and Apricot. At six and three months of age they are a little younger than we had planned, but it was important for us that Petal have some rattie friends, and once we'd seen the girls at the RSPCA we couldn't leave without them.

We've taken the first steps in introducing Petal to Daisy, Peach and Apricot. Petal is a lot older that the girls and she has some funny ways about her, but we know there is nothing more important for a rat than other rattie companions. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Petal and Daisy" class="size-full wp-image-7659" title="Our two rats, Petal and Daisy getting to know each other" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/post_1867.jpg" alt="Petal and Daisy" height="451" %} 

So far thing are going well. Peach and Apricot tend to hide in bed, but Daisy and Petal seem to get on. We've had no signs of aggression, which is good. Petal doesn't seem that interested in Daisy, preferring to eat and drink and carry on as normal, but Daisy is having none of that and seems genuinely interested in Petal.

It's also really hot here, which doesn't help things as Petal got a little over heated. She ended up flat out on the floor of the cage. I separated her from the others and gave her time to relax and she was fine and ready to meet everyone again.
