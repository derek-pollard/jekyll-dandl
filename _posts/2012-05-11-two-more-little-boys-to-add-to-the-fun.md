It may be hard to believe, but these two new arrivals are all Derek's fault! He spotted them at the pet store and had to point them out to me. I was trying to be strong and resist them, so Derek, very helpfully pointed out they were like a mini Pepper and Pippin. Well, that did it and home they came.

As the new boys are miniature versions of our past boys Pepper and Pippin, we have named them, Mango and Chips, well it makes sense to us. The boys are settling in really well, and we've had no problems introducing them to Kapy and Powy. Mango and Chips are very sweet and gentle little boys, and from the looks of things they adore our two bigger boys. It is lovely to see them all interacting and there have been no signs of aggression at all, which is wonderful. To look at the four of them you'd think they'd known each other all their lives. I'm really thrilled for the boys, as they all look so comfortable together, and of course it's great for me not having another cage to clean out. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignleft" width="390" caption="Mango" class="size-full wp-image-6415" title="Our new rat, Mango sitting in bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/post_3500.jpg" alt="Mango" height="356" %} 

Kapy and Powy have grown into their nickname of the 'Kapow Brothers' and are very rough and tumble with each other, but when it comes to Mango and Chips, they are so gentle and loving. It's amazing to see. The biggest problem we have is Kapy and Powy are very demonstrative rats, they love to groom each other, and they are quite rough about it, pulling the other one about in the process. The boys have already turned their attention to Mango and Chips, and Derek and I will often rush into the room hearing squeaking only to find some vigorous grooming going on.

I am not anticipating any problems developing between the boys, but I will keeping a close eye on them as they get older to make sure everyone is happy and no squabbles break out, as can happen with maturing rats. The boys all look so content with each other right now, I think they are going to continue to be best of friends.
