Pippin had the operation on his lump yesterday and everything went smoothly. We picked him yesterday afternoon and the poor little guy was still a bit wobbly. He was very glad to be back in his home and hid himself away for a good sleep. Come the evening he was looking a lot brighter and had some food. And when we checked on him this morning he'd climbed up to one of his favourite beds higher up in the cage and even came out for a little play.

The lump was an abscess so I'm very pleased we chose to have it removed so quickly. That also explains why it had grown so fast. Pippin is now on Baytril to help him fight any infections, and whatever caused the abscess in the first place.

We are so happy to have him home and, apart from his bald tummy, looking like his old self.
