This time it is our sweet, rather round boy, Moomin. We first noticed he wasn't chewing cardboard, he wasn't very interested to see us and was generally quite lethargic. Having experienced teeth problems in gerbils before, it was the first thing we checked and sure enough Moomin's top teeth weren't growing properly! This meant that not only was he having trouble chewing and eating, but his bottom teeth weren't being warn down.

Even though we have been through this before with our sweet gerbil, Almond, who lived a long and happy life with no teeth, it was still a shock. Just taking a little critter, like a gerbil, to the vet is incredibly stressful. You have no idea how they will react. On top of that there is the difficult procedure of filing down their remaining teeth. When you think of the size of us humans and a little gerbil mouth, even with the smallest equipment it's a difficult procedure. Luckily we were able to book Moomin in with the same vet who was so good at treating Almond.

Thank goodness our little Moomin was incredibly brave. The whole experience did knock him back a bit and he was very quiet for a couple of days. After a rest he bounced right back and was more than willing to eat all the extra, yummy fresh bread we were offering him. Cheeky Sunny wasn't too impressed that he had to eat gerbil food, but I think he was just happy to have his brother back and looking a lot better.

As Moomin can no longer eat gerbil food, we are feeding him a diet of bread (a gerbil favourite), broken up sunflower and pumpkin seeds, plus the broken up bits of bran flakes we find at the bottom of the cereal box. All of which Moomin and Sunny are loving.

Moomin was always quite a chubby boy and his weight is nice and stable and he is happy and active. Even though he can't chew it doesn't stop little Moomin 'play chewing', where he goes through all the motions of chewing cardboard, he just never destroys it. Sunny is happy too, he is very close to Moomin and it means the world to him to have his brother to play with. I know both boys love us and the care we give them, but they are peas in a pod and you can't imagine one without the other.

Derek and I are very positive about Moomin's future, even with no teeth. We've been through all this teeth trouble before with Almond and he thrived on being spoilt. Whether Moomin's top teeth will grow back is anyone's guess, we will keep checking because if they don't regrow he'll need to have his lower teeth filled down to prevent injury.

Right now we are happy to have our bubbly little guy back to his happy self and we'll do everything we can to keep him safe and healthy.
