It appeared quite quickly and is very soft. There were a few times I thought I felt a lump, but when I tried to feel for it I couldn't find it. With Topaz being so young, I tired to tell myself it was in my imagination. Fortunately I did not ignore my concerns and told Derek, who was thinking the same thing but didn't want to upset me.

With both of us suspecting the same thing we gave our wiggly little Topaz a thorough check over, which she did not appreciate, and sure enough found a squidgy lump. As much as we wanted to keep our baby rat home with us we knew what we had to do and Derek called our vet straight away.

Unfortunately things were not go smoothly. Our local and regular vet had recently been taken over by one of these large veterinary chains. Our first shock was they'd put all their prices up, a surgery on a little rat like Topaz would cost as much as an operation on a cat! Now of course we're not concerned about the money, but it did not reflect well on their dedication to small animals. Secondly our usual vet, who was not happy at the new small animal pricing policy, was also unwell. Although she was able to perform a consultation with Topaz she was not well enough to carry out the surgery. Our vet had already limited small animal consultations to one specialist vet, which we didn't mind, because she was great, but this was just too much. Ama, our vet actually recommended we go elsewhere with Topaz, so we did. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Topaz just before her surgery" class="size-full wp-image-9423" title="Our rat Topaz leaning on Derek's hand" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/post_7842.jpg" alt="Topaz just before her surgery" height="432" %} 

All the drama with our usual vet delayed Topaz's surgery a bit and her lump was growing quite quickly, so we were getting very upset with it all. There is another veterinary surgery in our local area who are great, they are just not as close to us as our usual vet. We arrange for Topaz to see them as soon as we could. They were great and agreed to book Topaz in without a consultation first, which was lovely of them.

We took Topaz in this morning and had a little chat with the vet, just to make sure everything was as described. We've been through many a surgery with our little rats, but the waiting never gets easier and I was so very happy to collect our groggy little Topaz mid-afternoon.

She's a floppy little bundle of sleepiness and her sisters have no idea what to make of her. I know some people like to keep their rats separate after an operation but I've never had much success at it. My little rats always seem so much happier with the comfort of their siblings to keep them warm. Of course I keep a close eye on them to make sure everyone is calm and no-one messes with the wound.

Right now all the girls are quiet, well except for Topaz, who will not leave her tummy alone. There is no distracting her and I am sure she is chewing her stitches -- sigh.

There's nothing I can do about it right now, other than tell her off gently and complain here! We'll see how she is tomorrow, we have lots of medicine for her and at least I have some experience of open wounds!
