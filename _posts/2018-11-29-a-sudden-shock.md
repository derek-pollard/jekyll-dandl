Oh my goodness, I really don't know where to begin. We have lost our little Sage and it was all such a big shock. I had found a lump on Sage's tummy, nothing major, and I knew straight away I wanted to have it removed. We took her to the vet to get her booked in. Now the vet we saw wasn't our normal small animal specialist vet, but still she was great. She checked the lump and booked Sage in for her surgery with the small animal vet.

The morning of Sage's surgery came around and we still weren't worried. By now we have had many lumps removed from our rats and they normally come through fine and recover well. Sadly though, we got a call only an hour after dropping Sage off. Once she had been anaesthetised and easier to examine, the vet could see poor Sage was riddled with tiny lumps, some which would have been inoperable.

It was a horrible shock, but we agreed with the vet the best thing to do was let Sage go peacefully. It absolutely broke my heart, as we had planned for simple operation and weren't even worried. Sage was so healthy and full of life, but those amount of tumours would soon have taken their toll on her, we could only let her go. Our sweet Sage was such a lovely girl. Sundew is crazy outgoing and baby Ivy is the shy one, Sage was always in the middle. A friendly girl, who loved a cuddle and happily wandered around at playtime. Of course there was also her beautiful nose marking that first caught my eye sticking out of bed in the adoption centre. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Sage out and about" class="size-full wp-image-8736" title="Our sweet rat, Sage, out on our bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/post_0059.jpg" alt="Sage out and about" height="437" %} 

The hole Sage has left, as with all our rats, is a big one. We will take extra special care of her two sisters in her memory.
