At the beginning of the month we finally persuaded our [cat, Cubbie](/cats/inkie/) to leave the house. He's a shy boy, and is very nervous about doing anything new. There was no graceful way to introduce Fern to our new cat, he's a big boy and there is no holding him. The important thing is we knew he'd never hurt her, he's not that kind of cat, so it would be a case of letting them work it out. At first Fern was not impressed with the new arrival, being such a shy boy Cubbie kind of skulked around the garden. While we knew his behaviour was due to his nervous disposition, Fern was a little upset by his presence, as to her it looked like he was hunting or even reacting to a real danger. This would cause Fern to stamp her feet and get quite tense whenever Cubbie was near by.

I'm delighted to say that with a little time and reassurance for Fern, the two of them have worked it out and they are now best buddies. Cubbie chooses to spend his days sitting in the garden, which means he is always there for Fern to play with and she loves it.
