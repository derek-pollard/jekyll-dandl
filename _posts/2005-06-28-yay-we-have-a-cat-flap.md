We finally got a cat flap fitted, we'd had a chap out to do some work on the garden for us, Derek mentioned the cat flap problem to him and he said he's see what he could do. Several weeks passed and the chap phoned us to say he'd found a special saw that would cut through the metal door skin. It took him a very noisy hour to hack through the door, but I'm pleased to say he did it and the cat flap fitted perfectly. We were both so happy all we had to do was get the cats to use it, no problems there. Custard who was already in the garden came up to the new cat flap bumped it a few times to test it out and then just came in. Treacle was just as easy, he wandered up to the back door to be let out saw the new flap and left. As far as the cats are concerned our home is now complete. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="The boys enjoying our new improved garden" class="size-full wp-image-6569 " title="Our two cats enjoying the sunshine in our back garden" src="/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/post_9090.jpg" alt="The boys enjoying the our new improved garden" height="504" %}
