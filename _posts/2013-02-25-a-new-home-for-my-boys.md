Not all rats suit the same cage style and this is proving true with my boys, particularly Kapy and Powy who have developed into rather large and clumsy chaps. Their old cage was a tall one, with lots of shelves and hanging beds it to encourage climbing and adventure. Unfortunately my guys just didn't get on with it, and after Kapy hurt his foot I was worried someone was going to end up having a serious accident. So, I'd been looking around for new cages for awhile when I saw a two storey rabbit cage at our local pet shop, and I knew I'd found the perfect cage for my guys.

The new cage is a Ferplast, Rabbit 100 Double. It is a two tier cage designed for dwarf rabbits and guinea pigs. As with so many pet cages, it doesn't seem very suited to its intended inhabitants, not that I have to worry about that, because my rats love it. They look great in it too. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="The boys new home" class="size-full wp-image-6423" title="Our new rat cage the Ferplast, Rabbit 100 Double" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/post_0414.jpg" alt="The boys new home" height="555" %} 

The boys have actually gained more space with the new cage, as its a bit wider than their old one and about as high. My only concern is the wooden ramp between the two levels. It's nice and smooth so I'm not worried about splinters, but if it gets to smelly I'll have to sort out an alternative. For now the ramp provides some great exercise for them, as their main sleeping area is upstairs and their food and water is downstairs. I've added all their old beds and shelves, minus the wooden ledges that were a bit small for the larger boys, so everything is pretty much the same for them, and all their sleeping areas are linked by tubes so once up there they can get around, hopefully without falling. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Its tiring moving house" class="size-full wp-image-6424" title="Our four rats snuggled up in bed together.

When I first put them in the new cage there was some confusion, they couldn't figure out the whole upstairs downstairs concept. It was quiet funny watching them wondering why their home had shrunk, but with a bit of encouragement we got them upstairs and they were up and down like it was a great game. Things have gone a bit quiet now though, I think they've worn themselves out so we'll probably be giving playtime a miss tonight.

No doubt the new door arrangement will be another challenge. For some reason our boys like exiting their cage through the top door. On their old cage the whole top section opened and they'd pour out of it. This cage doesn't work like that, there is a nice big sliding door downstairs and then upstairs the whole front opens up. The boys love coming out though, so I'm hopeful they'll figure it all out. I guess I'll have to wait until they've had a big sleep to find out though.
