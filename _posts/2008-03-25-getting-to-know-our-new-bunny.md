Fawn has taken a little time to settle into his new home. He was very shy and hesitant at first and we struggled to even get him to come out of his cage an play, when he did he preferred to hang around under our bed. I’m pleased to say that he is starting to build his confidence now, and is turning into a very sweet and affectionate little rabbit.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6610" title="Our dwarf bunny, Fawn enjoying some fuss" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/post_0854.jpg" alt="Our dwarf bunny, Fawn enjoying some fuss" width="780" height="450" /> 

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6611" title="Dwarf bunny, Fawn enjoying a carrot" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/post_1365.jpg" alt="Dwarf bunny, Fawn enjoying a carrot" width="390" height="368" /> Everyday Fawn’s confidence is growing and he becomes more adventurous with his surroundings and us. At the moment he seems very interested in the stairs. We are hoping he will learn to use them by himself and then he can have the run of the whole house. Who knows what kind of mischief he’ll get up to then.

Our little guy is a bit of a carrot monster too; boy does he love his carrots. I know we shouldn’t feed him too many, but as his confidence grows and he gets more active it’s hard not to want to treat him. We give him other vegetables as well, but I think carrots are his favourite.

We have read that Fawn’s personality being completely opposite to Fern’s is going to be a good thing when we introduce them. Apparently bossy bunnies prefer gentle and subservient companions who they can boss around. So fingers crossed. We’re still a bit away from being able to introduce the rabbits, but it doesn’t hurt to be hopeful. Our first two pairs of bunnies were siblings, so we have never had to introduce rabbits before.
