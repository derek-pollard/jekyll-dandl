Old age just caught up with him and he gradually became weaker and started to loose his appetite. We agreed with our vet that any treatment they could offer would only be more distressing for Badger and it was best for him to let him go peacefully.

Badger had such a difficult start to his life, being so poorly as a baby and needing so much attention. He became very spoilt and expected rather a lot from us, not that we minded he was such a gentle little soul it was a pleasure to be around him. He grew into a very bossy little chap if we tried to get him out of bed when he didn't want to he would wiggle and squeak until we gave in. He loved running around on the floor in the evening and if we didn't sit on the floor with him he would get very cross and even nibble our toes. He had us so very well trained and now he has gone he has left a very big hole in our lives. We miss Badger so very very much, he was a cheeky little chap, who ate far to much of our dinner. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Willow, Biscuit & Badger enjoying some dinner" class="size-full wp-image-6997" title="My three rats enjoying some of our dinner" src="/wp-content/uploads/2004/08/post_7152_IMG.jpg" alt="Willow, Biscuit & Badger enjoying some dinner" height="507" %}
