We were really pleased that Fawn and our new little cat, Inkie had become such firm friends and I'm absolutely thrilled to say that Fawn was doubly excited to meet Cubbie.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6638" title="Our cat, Cubbie and bunny, Fawn looking down the stairs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/post_1998.jpg" alt="Our cat, Cubbie and bunny, Fawn looking down the stairs" width="780" height="392" /> 

Inkie was still a kitten when she joined our family from the RSPCA, but Cubbie was fully grown and he is a big cat. When we first met Cubbie at the homing centre, we knew he was a big softy, but that didn't mean Fawn would like him. Despite having to deal with Inkie's crazy games and having to put her in her place Fawn was thrilled to meet Cubbie. I can't really say the feeling is mutual though, as Cubbie doesn't seem to know what to make of Fawn and kind of stares at him blankly. This doesn't stop Fawn who follows his new friend around everywhere. This is helped by the fact Cubbie is really shy and timid and only comes downstairs when we feed him. So Fawn and Cubbie get to spend a lot of time together.

It's really great to see Fawn with his new friends. We do worry about him being on his own - as our grumpy bunny Fern won't be Fawn's friend. But now things have worked out really well and we will often see Cubbie run across the landing, followed by Inkie and then Fawn, kicking his little feet up with excitement.
