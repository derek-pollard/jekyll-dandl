I'm pleased to say Wheatie has settled in really well and is blossoming into a wonderful confident little fellow, which is no bad thing as our cat Inkie couldn't wait for an invite to meet him. Wheatie lives on the end of Derek's desk in our home office, which makes him very accessible to a nosy cat like Inkie. Fortunately Inkie is a very gentle little cat, still she is still a predator and Wheatie doesn't know she can't actually get to him.

There is something about gerbils that cats can't resist. We have seen this before with our other cats, they aren't that fussed about our rats, but show them a gerbil and they have to get as close as possible. While we would never let Inkie get her paws on Wheatie, or any of our rodents, it is impossible to keep her away from Wheatie's home. Not that he cares, like many of our gerbils before Wheatie seems to enjoy the audience to his digging, chomping and general gerbilness.
