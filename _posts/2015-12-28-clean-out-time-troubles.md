I have a very relaxed attitude towards our little critters, sometimes a little too relaxed and Derek doesn't always appreciate it! Clean out time was one such occasion. He was off washing out the gerbils cage base for me, while I supervised the girls and was supposed to keep them out of trouble.

I was sitting near the bucket of old sawdust, when Olive climbed on my knee and tried to reach it. She couldn't so I moved it closer and our cheeky little gerbil wasted no time in jumping in. I thought it was magical watching her and grabbed my phone and started to record her. As is the way with happy gerbils, Olive's excitement and bravery grew until she was digging and kicking out dirty sawdust all over the place. That's when Derek returned and I got in trouble, still it makes for a fun video :-).
