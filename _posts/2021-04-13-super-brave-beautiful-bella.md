Our sweet little Bella had her operation yesterday and I am very happy to say it was good news - her horrible lump was an abscess!

The morning of her surgery was not easy. Bella came out to play as normal with her family and had a great time. She went in happily and was even up and waiting for me when it was time to collect her to take her to the vet, which was a relief. I feel so mean if I have to drag them out of bed.

Everything was going fine until she laid eyes on the pet carrier. As soon as I lowered her towards it she panicked and ran up my arm. This happened several times and in the end I carried her downstairs on my shoulder, bringing the carrier with us. I thought being in an unfamiliar room would distract her, and it did to some extent. We had a bit of a wrestle, but I got in her in the pet carrier and shut the lid without any trapped fingers or tails.

She wasn't happy on the drive to the vet, and when we got there and parked I as able to open her carrier and she squeaked when I touched her. It just about broke my heart, knowing I was scaring our little girl like that, but it did have to be done. Fortunately it didn't take long for someone to come and collect her. Not that I wanted to leave her, but it at least meant she was nearer her surgery and coming home again.

We got a call just after twelve, to tell us Bella was okay and we could collect her a bit later at two o'clock. They also explained that the horrible lump that had been growing under her armpit was in fact an abscess. It was a strange kind of shock at first, then as it sank in as a huge relief.

The lump had come up a couple of months ago and at first we thought it was just a bit of chub, but then it began to grow and form more of a defined lump. Our first thought was a tumour. We've experienced abscesses with rats before, and usually they have presented as horrible, hot lumps that start to turn black and burst of their own accord. The lump Bella had was nothing like that, it always seemed quite soft, and understandably she didn't like us looking at it, never mind touching it.

The fact that it had been growing for so long, with no sign of bursting, says we did the right thing getting her surgery, no matter how stressful it had been. The vet cleaned the abscess out while she was under anaesthetic and left the small hole open, to help it drain and heal naturally. Bella was understandably a little stressed when she got home, although I'm pretty sure the relief of having that horrible infection removed made her feel a lot better.

It is always difficult taking adopted rats away from their home and family, and Bella was no different. I always find rats who've been with us from babies and have had no traumas, cope much better with vet visits. They may not like what is happening to them, but having not experienced anything traumatic, they are just a bit stressed by the intrusion. With adopted rats, my biggest fear is they think I'm sending them away, like with how Bella reacted so badly to the sight of the pet carrier, never mind being put in it.

Of course I'll never know what they really think, but she certainly knew when she was home. As soon as I stepped through the front door Bella emerged from her towel nest, where she'd been hidden since we collected her, and was ready to rejoin her family. When I picked her up to pop her back in her home, she did squeak, not that I blame her for being cross with me. Within minutes of being home she was chomping on rat food in the safety of an igloo and looking really good.

Later that night she came out to play, after being given some rat nuggets that she stashed. Obviously that was a sign that things were okay, because she came down and joined her family in running around.

That was yesterday, and this morning she was back to her old self at play time, you wouldn't know what she'd been through or that she has a little hole under her armpit. This morning was also clean out time, which didn't stress her at all, which was nice. She also seems to have forgiven me for dragging her off yesterday. So, hopefully we can put it all behind us, get our Bella all healed up and not think about lumps or bumps ever again.
