After the arrival of our [new gerbils](/gerbils/cherry-plum-olive/), Inkie has been very impatient to meet them all. Originally we had all six of our new arrivals upstairs in our home office, which offers limited access for Inkie - she gets fur all over our computers if we leave her alone in there. As the [gerbils got older](/gerbils/acorn-almond-cashew/) we had to split the boys up from their sisters and they are now in our dinning room, this means Inkie can visit with them whenever she wants. We are being very careful that she doesn'tÂ get carried away with the excitement of our tiny additions, but for now Inkie is enjoying lots of gerbils watching.
