It has been a difficult two weeks for our little family and I'm very sad to say we've said goodbye to both out precious little Juniper and our super adventurous Bluebell. While its been an emotional time, we were at least able to take some comfort knowing both girls slipped away peacefully at home. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Juniper" class="size-full wp-image-8745" title="Our sweet rat, Juniper" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/post_5205.jpg" alt="Juniper" height="312" %} 

Baby Juniper passed away first, she was behaving rather frail and had lost a bit of weight, but nothing we could quite describe. With the passing of Jasmine and Lilac the dynamics of the rats had changed slightly. Juniper had always been very close to Jasmine, so at first we weren't sure if Juniper's melancholy was due to the loss of her sisters, but as time passed we realised that Juniper was just slowing down with age. She was still a super friendly and happy little girl, but I'd noticed she wasn't moving around her home as much. I had taken to spoiling her and making sure she was getting lots of food in bed, maybe there were a few extra treats too :-). As her activity levels dropped, Juniper spent a lot more time enjoying cuddles during her out of cage time. It was during one of these cuddle times she just slipped away. I wasn't even aware she had left me at first. She was cuddled up in a fluffy towel and I thought she had fallen asleep, but sadly I realised she had passed away. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Bluebell" class="size-full wp-image-8746" title="Our beautiful little rat, Bluebell" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/post_0072.jpg" alt="Bluebell" height="411" %} 

While Juniper's activity levels were dropping, we had also noticed the Bluebell was losing weight. She was eating healthily and still very active, so we didn't worry too much. We'd always had the feeling Bluebell and Buttercup were a little older than our other three girls. When you adopt rat, you never know for sure how old they are, and after many years of living with rats, you get to recognise the stages they go through. So, we'd always had the inkling that Bluebell was more senior than we first thought, not that age ever stopped her getting into all sorts of mischief.

It wasn't until the very end that Bluebell's energy levels dropped. We had moved our remaining three girls, Bluebell, Buttercup and Lilac, into what we lovingly call a retirement cage. The retirement cages are lower than our normal rat cages which means elderly rats can't climb so high, which as they get more frail and clumsy keeps them safe. Bluebell had only been in the retirement cage a short while when she started to slip away from us. Her passing was fairly quick, she just sort of stopped over a few days and then she left us peacefully. While we are always sad to see any of our little critters go, it was a beautiful end for our adventurous and happy little girl.
