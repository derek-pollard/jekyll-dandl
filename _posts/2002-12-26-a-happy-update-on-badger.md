<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6987" title="Our beautiful husky rat, Badger" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/12/post_5853_IMG.jpg" alt="Our beautiful husky rat, Badger" width="470" height="287" />We are very pleased to say Badger is 100% better, his snuffles and sneezing are all gone. We had several worrying months while he was a baby and at times it seemed like he would not recover, but our beautiful little Badger kept fighting. He didn't grow much at first but as his snuffling subsided he put on a growth spurt and has turned into a very large happy healthy chap.

Now Badger is older and bigger his body is much stronger to fight his infection and it has now been a month since we had any sneezing from him. We do keep a very close eye on Badger to make sure he stays healthy. Plus the home he shares with his two brothers is cleaned out twice a week, because living in a clean and happy home is the most important thing to keeping little ratties healthy, oh and lots of food!
