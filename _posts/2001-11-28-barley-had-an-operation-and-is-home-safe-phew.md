Barley went for her check up with the vets and unfortunately there was no improvement with her tooth, so they had to operate. We were very frightened for our little friend, and it was a very long morning waiting to find out if she was okay.

We phoned the vets at one o'clock to check on her, and found we'd had no need to worry Barley was up and about and amusing everyone with her antics. Even the vet commented on how well she had recovered from the anaesthetic. When we went to collect her, Barley was busy in her little travel tank digging away, you wouldn't believe she had just had an anaesthetic and a tooth removed. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="'Yum'" class="size-full wp-image-6502" title="Our gerbil, Barely enjoying a plate of baby food" src="/wp-content/uploads/2001/11/post_4299.jpg" alt="'Yum'" height="331" %} 

It is a great relief to have her home safe and sound. Its going to be a diet of baby food, fruit and mushy cereal for Barley while she recovers, and I don't think she minds one little bit.
