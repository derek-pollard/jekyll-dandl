With the dramatic way Willow joined our family, him being a little boy, roughly the same age as Biscuit and Badger, and the fact he is such a sweet little chap, it seemed only right that we should introduce them. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="310" caption="Grumpy Biscuit" class="size-full wp-image-6967" title="Our baby rat, Biscuit hiding in a hamster igloo" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/10/post_5580_IMG.jpg" alt="Grumpy Biscuit" height="281" %} 

We had been keeping Willow separate from Biscuit and Badger, in case he had any illnesses he could pass on to them. Incredibly despite all Willow had been through, he is very healthy. Badger still has his sneezing problem, but we are sure that is some sort of allergic reaction, to what we don't know, but we are sure its not an illness.

As Biscuit can still be a bit shy, we introduced Badger to Willow first, and it was amazing. Badger and Willow were like long lost brothers. They really were so happy to see each other and the most amazing thing was the whole time they were playing Badger didn't sneeze!

After the success of Badger and Willow's meeting, we felt it would be cruel to split them up and so we let Willow move into Biscuit and Badger's cage. Biscuit wasn't that interested in the new arrival. He has claimed a little hamster igloo as his own and it seems as long as Willow doesn't try and move in with him, Biscuit is happy.
