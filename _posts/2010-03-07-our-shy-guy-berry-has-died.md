<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6460" title="Our sweet gerbil, Berry standing on his hind legs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/post_3987.jpg" alt="Our sweet gerbil, Berry standing on his hind legs" width="310" height="356" />While loosing Berry is another blow for our family, I can say that he passed away peacefully from old age. A few days ago we noticed we were seeing less of him, and then yesterday he just wasn't himself and we knew we were going to lose him. While it made us very sad to know he was going to leave us, with all the upset and illness we've been through with our rats, seeing Berry slipping away peacefully at a good age did give us some comfort.

Berry was very special to us, even if our relationship was a little odd, and he passed away the way he lived his life - quietly and in his own time. He wasn't big on coming out to play or being petted by us, but he still had a large presence in our lives. We are going to miss catching glimpses of him while we are eating our dinner. He'd often sit watching us and once we'd spotted him, he'd dart back into his maze of boxes and sawdust not to be seen again!

I can honestly say Berry was not like any other gerbil we have ever known, but I'm pretty sure he was happy in his secluded little life and we are very happy to have known him.
