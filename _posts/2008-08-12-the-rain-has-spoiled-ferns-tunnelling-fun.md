Fern's busyness has been brought to an abrupt halt by the rain. It poured it down last night and has filled the tunnel Fern was digging with water. By the time she came out to play the water had drained away, but it was still pretty muddy down there. Fern took one look and was not impressed. I guess mud doesn't make for good digging conditions.

Not to worry though, Fern went back to eating the plants and finding other troublesome things to do. I'm sure once things have dried out she will be back to work. Though I do hope she gets tired of digging soon, or we are going to have to find away to stop her. At the rate she's going she'll have dug such a long tunnel we won't be able to see where it goes or get her back out of it!

It's difficult finding a balance between letting Fern enjoy herself and trying to keep her safe at the same time. Plus the garden looks a bit of a mess at the moment with all he displaced soil Fern keeps pushing around. We understand she is a very active little girl and really want encourage that, and it is amazing to see what she can achieve in such a small amount of time. Nothing can stop her, not even rocks that she encounters they just get thrown out with the soil. Still if she doesn't stop soon we'll have to think up something before she tunnels her way out of the garden!
