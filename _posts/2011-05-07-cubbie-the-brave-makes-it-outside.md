Bless him. It certainly is a long and winding road getting to know our sweet guy, Cubbie. He's such a lovely boy and he obviously tries very hard, but goodness does he take a long time, and a lot of encouragement, to do things. When it came to getting him outside I have to admit Derek kind of lost our patience. It was just getting far too frustrating for us, every time we went outside to sit with our bunny, Fern, he'd come to the dinning room window and watch us through the glass!

In a bout of frustration we cornered our sweet guy, grabbed him and dragged him outside. It was not very glamorous, Cubbie is a very big cat and he does not like being picked up at all, still we kept hold of him long enough to get him down the bottom of the garden. Once released Cubbie flew down the garden and back through the cat flap and we felt terrible. That was until the next day and Cubbie snuck out by himself.

For the next week or so Cubbie would venture into the garden without any encouragement, but rather upsettingly he'd shoot back in when we went out to see Fern. Gradually we have seen improvement in our silly cat and Cubbie now stays out with us, choosing to skulk around in the shrubbery rather than sit out in plain sight. Our bunny Fern is not too sure of this new arrival in her garden, as Cubbie moves around quite low to the ground, almost like he's hunting, it bothers Fern because she doesn't know that he's a big scaredy cat who wouldn't hurt a fly. The way Cubbie's going I'm sure his confidence will keep improving and who knows he and Fern may end up best of friends. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Cubbie peers our from the flower bed behind Inkie" class="size-full wp-image-6063" title="Our cat, Cubbie peers our from the flower bed, while Inkie lays on the path in front of him" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/post_2437.jpg" alt="Our cat, Cubbie peers our from the flower bed, while Inkie lays on the path in front of him" height="480" %}
