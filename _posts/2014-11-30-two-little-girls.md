These two are all Derek's fault he tricked me and then wouldn't take no for an answer. I was still very upset after the passing of my two [gorgeous husky boys, Bandit and Wombat](/bandit-wombat/), combined with the sudden loss of [Whisper and Truffle](/pika-chewie-maize-oatie-whisper-truffle/) all within the space of a month, I was feeling quite heartbroken and low. In my grief I'd made the comment that I didn't think I could have anymore rats, but Derek decided otherwise. The day after loosing Bandit, we needed to pop to the pet shop for sawdust, which is conveniently - for Derek's plan - located next to their adoption centre. And who should be watching us from inside a tank, but two little female rats.

Blossom and Maisy were ex-pets shop rats who had been taken ill while waiting for a home. They had been moved into the back of the store and treated for their respiratory problems, and after making a full recovery were now in the adoption area ready to find a new home - and Derek decided that home should be with us. I still wasn't sure, so it was left to Derek to handle the girls and let them test his fingers for tastiness, as inquisitive little rats are prone to do.

Despite their difficult start to life, Blossom and Maisy are very confident and well handled little girls and I'm pleased to say they have not been fazed by their new home at all. We have been having lots of fun getting to know our new girls, who are so confident they were happy to be handled and cuddled almost as soon as we were home. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Maisy" class="size-full wp-image-6315" title="Our new rat, Maisy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/post_32521.jpg" alt="Maisy" height="193" %} 

I still miss my boys terribly, but I have to admit I'm enjoying watching my new crazy girls as they explore their new home and I'm quite excited to get to know them.
