<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9042" title="Our husky rat, Sugar in her hammock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/post_0529.jpg" alt="Our husky rat, Sugar in her hammock" width="390" height="362" />Our sweet, and sometimes bossy, girl Sugar is beginning to slow down quite a bit and is a little unsteady on her feet. We are assuming it is old age, as she wasn't a young girl when she joined our family over a year ago.

It is both a bit sad to know she is getting old, but at the same time, with all the traumas of loosing out younger rats, good to know she has reached old age makes us feel very proud. I don't like to think of loosing her as a year is such a sort time to spend with such a special little girl, but I think Derek and I have made her very happy. We love spending time with her and will up until the end, but we know it is coming, just not when.

I think Sugar was very hurt by her first family and she liked to take it out on me and give me a hard time. She liked to make sure we knew she was boss. Like when it was time to come out and play she'd make me wait until SHE was ready to come out before I could pick her up. If I didn't wait I'd get a warning chomp to keep me in my place.

Things started to change when Peal died and Sugar started to get closer to Derek. She would hang around him more and seek his attention. I think she still likes to give me a hard time, and that makes sense seeing as her first owner was also a woman. Since she has started to slow down she seems happier to accept attention from both of us and we are making the most of it and giving her lots of cuddles. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Cuddle time" class="size-full wp-image-9044" title="Cuddling my rat Sugar" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/post_1094.jpg" alt="Cuddle time" height="584" %} 

We love Sugar very much, she has such a huge charater and is very beautiful. Derek and I have a real soft spot for Husky rats, thanks to our [cuddly guy Badger](/biscuit-badger-willow/ "Biscuit, Badger & Willow"), and Sugar and Pearl both being huskys was one of the reasons we decided to adopt the girls.
