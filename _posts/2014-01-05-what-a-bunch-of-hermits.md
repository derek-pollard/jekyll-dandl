Oh dear my new boys are a right lazy bunch. Trying to get them out of their cage to play is like pulling teeth, honestly they would rather spend all their time piled up in one bed together, all seven of them. I always want what is best for my boys and don't want to make them do anything they don't want - I'm just not sure it's healthy for them to sleep all day long. The worst bit is everyday Derek and I lift their huge cage down onto the floor so they can come out and they barely bat an eye. The cage weighs and awful lot, especially with them in it, and it takes both of us to lift it, but it seems so wrong not to give them the chance to come out and play. I just wish they'd appreciate it.

One thing they do get up for is to share in our dinner. That is the downside to having rats in the dinning room, they want your food and no matter how shy that are they know how to make soppy, begging eyes at you until you give in.

Despite their laziness they are gorgeous boys and it's wonderful to see them making our guy Chips so happy.
