We had both agreed no more rats, but I had to pop back down the garden centre foor some more rat supplies. While there I couldn't help noticing a rat they had there. He was obviously not a baby and I was curious as to where he had come from, as we had only taken Mole, Mouse & Ferret from them a few weeks before. The assistant there explained to me the the rat had been returned to the store for being vicious. I do not beleive there is such a thing as a vicous rat, just badly handled ones, and so after a quick call to Derek I agreed to take the rat home with me.

He is a very stressed little guy. The guy at the garden centre had to wear gloves to put him in a travel box for me and I could tell even with the gloves on he did not want to handle the rat. Once I got him home and put him in a cage he went beserk, climbing the bars and along the roof to see if he could find a way out. The poor little thing is understandably terrified. I can't image what he feels like being taken back to the noisy garden centre like that and his first family were probably not very patient with him if he did bite them.

As the new arrival appears to be a similar age to Mole and his brothers, I hope, once he's had time to calm down, that he'll be able to live with them. I'm sure having some big cuddly brothers will help him settle down and start to feel safe.
