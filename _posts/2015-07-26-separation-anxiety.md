<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6976" title="Our baby gerbil, Almond in his new home" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/post_2422.jpg" alt="Our baby gerbil, Almond in his new home" width="390" height="346" />Not the gerbils, me! The boys are now happily installed in their new home and they are loving it, me not so much. I knew it had to happen but I miss the chaos of six gerbils in one tank. On the bright side I will have double the gerbily playtime, as they will need to be kept completely separate from now on. It was hard work keeping track of everyone when the gerbils were out, especially when they started coming and going of their own accord.

The boys now live in our dining room alongside our three rather [lazy rats](/rats/pika-chewie-maize-oatie-whisper-truffle/). They all seem very happy together, and we have already had the boys out to play. They were a little unsure of their new surroundings at first, but they soon got their confidence up. The dining room is much more exciting than the landing they were used to, so they had lots to explore. We kept their first run short, so they could all go in with a happy memoryÂ of their new experience and will look forward to coming out again. Acorn and Cashew put themselves away happily, but little Almond got a bit stressed. Amazingly Cashew actually came back out to get him! It was incredible to see, and once Almond was safely in Cashew followed him up the ramp.

Gerbils are only tiny creatures, and we have known many over the years, but they will never cease to amaze me what bright and loving little critters they are.
