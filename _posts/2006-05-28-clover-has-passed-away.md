It's been a difficult year for our little ratties. Firstly we had our little Clover put to sleep in March, she had an inoperable tumour that had begun to interfere with her quality of life. Coral took the loss of her sister very hard. Loosing her appetite and being very naughty were just some of the ways she showed us her unhappiness. Worryingly during this time Coral lost quite a bit of weight and developed a respiratory infection, while her eating has returned to normal she is still on a course of baytril and we are hoping that we can get her back to full health.

Cookie has also been giving us cause for concern, by being a very naughty little boy. He always had a bad habit of nipping his sisters behind their ears and since Clover has gone he only has Coral to harass. As a result poor Coral has ended up with a bald head and she does look a little odd. There is nothing malicious in the way Cookie is towards his sister, she doesn't squeak or even try to get away from him. If anything Coral is more than capable of beating Cookie up, even with her breathing problems. All we have been able to do is tell Cookie off whenever we catch him nipping his sister, but of course he never listens to us. He is a wobbly old boy now, we're not sure exactly how old his is, but given what we were told at the homing centre and how long he's lived with us he must well over two and a half years old, so he his no real danger to anyone but himself when he gets over ambitious with his climbing and lands on his bottom. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Coral and Cookie" class="size-full wp-image-7172" title="Our two rats, Coral and Cookie, trying to get back in their cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/post_7009.jpg" alt="Coral and Cookie" height="574" %}
