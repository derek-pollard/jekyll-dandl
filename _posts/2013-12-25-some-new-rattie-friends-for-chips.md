After a few days by himself, we could see our sweet guy Chips wasn't happy on his own. We tried to give him lots of attention, and treats, but nothing could make up for the loss of his brothers. What once was a lovely big cage looked so lonely and sad, with little Chips wandering around like he was looking for some company. I didn't think putting him in a smaller home would help, he'd still be by himself and probably wonder where he was. So there was nothing for it - I started the search for some new brothers.

Knowing I wanted mature rats I started my search at the RSPCA, but the two boys they had were very poorly and I could not risk Chips health by adopting them. It was on a visit to the pet store I discovered some rather large boys who needed a home. While I only intended to get Chips two, maybe three brothers, we ended up with [six new rats](/pets/rats/pika-chewie-maize-oatie-whisper-truffle/)! Not that Chips cared, he was just thrilled to have some new ratite company. It's great to see our sweet guy looking so happy and most importantly always in the middle of a sleeping pile of rats.
