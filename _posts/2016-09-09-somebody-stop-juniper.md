Oh my goodness, Juniper really is a live-wire. Her confidence is growing everyday and while the girls are still confined to the office at playtime there isn't anywhere Juniper hasn't explored.

We are exhausted and never know where we are going to find our crazy little rat next. The other three girls are finding their confidence at their own pace, which is what we want. Our only concern is that Juniper will get bored of the office before our other girls are ready to leave. Our cats room also makes a wonderful rattie playground, but if our little rats aren't ready it can make a very difficult place to retrieve them from if they chose to hide form us. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Our baby rat, Juniper in different mischievous places" class="size-full wp-image-7735" title="Little Juniper getting into lots of trouble " src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/junipertrouble.jpg" alt="Our baby rat, Juniper in different mischievous places" height="338" %} 

Time will tell what Juniper gets unto next, but I am hopeful she'll calm down a bit as her sisters get more adventurousÂ and give her someone to play with.
