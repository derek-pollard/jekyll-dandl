Its the same old story, I'm afraid. I was still feeling pretty low from the loss of [my girls Blossom and Maisy](/blossom-maisy/), but had to visit the pet store for degu food. Walking past the rats for sale I saw the back end of a beige hooded rat and thought it looked lovely. As Derek and I were out on our bicycles we headed home, but I did mention the rat to him. Despite saying we weren't going to have anymore rats, because they do break your heart when you lose them, he offered to take me to see the rat and find out who else was there.

Well, much to my dismay I discovered one to the group of rats was a dumbo. Neither Derek or I are particularly fond of dumbo rats. We had Smudge and Muffin and they were adorable, but boy they were ugly. So the sight of a dumbo put me off. Not to be deterred, as there were other rats we couldn't see he went to find an assistant. It turned out there were four rats, two dumbos and two normal eared rats all girls. Seeing one of the normal eared rats was a husky, I was instantly sold, so of course her little black sister had to join her. Derek agreed, but there was something about the beige hooded rat that I couldn't resist, even though she was a little ugly. Big softy that he is Derek could not refuse, and leaving one of the normal eared rats behind was not an option, so four little unplanned ratties have joined our family.

Besides two of them being dumbo rats, the girls are all very different in colouring. Juniper is our lovely shiny black rat, with gorgeous little pink feet and white spots on her tummy. Jasmine is a husky, always irresistible to me. Lilac is a lovely beige hooded rat and I'm not sure if her eyes are a really deep ruby or are actually black. Then last but by no means least, is Lily, with her agouti hood. They are a wonderful mix and I wonder if their personalities will be as diverse.

We've only had them a couple of hours and they are incredibly inquisitive. Lily is the shyest of the bunch, she's still hidden away somewhere, but I'm sure she'll be as confident as her sisters soon enough. We are making sure not to bother them in their new home, but they are happily exploring with us in the room, and are not at all bothered with us moving around. I'm sure they will wear themselves out soon though and be ready for a big sleep.
