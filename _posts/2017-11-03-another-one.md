Fern is still going strong and ruling her garden with an iron paw. All new visitors to the garden must be introduced to our bunny, and we followed this strict rule when our new cat, Jessie ventured outside. Being slightly more mature in years, Fern isn't quite so interested in our new cat and we think Jessie will be spared being chased by a playful bunny.

She may not be chasing the cats, but Fern is still digging up the garden.
