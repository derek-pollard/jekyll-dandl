Some days he doesn't even try to use them, when he comes out to play he will pull himself along with his front legs. We've decided not to take him to the vet, we know he is over weight, and probably quite old. As horrible as it may sound if there was anything the vet could do it would probably be very expensive and stressful for Tomato. So, we have decided to keep an eye on him for now. We are making sure he's getting plenty of water and still eating.

Fingers crossed he'll be ok, but I know we have to be realistic.

We love our Tomato.
