Oh my goodness how much little Rocket has grown in the past couple of weeks. He's caught right up with his sister in size and is actually a little wider than her now. He still has his baby face and acts like a cuddly little baby as well, but he has grown. It's amazing to see.

Poor Rocket is still a bit sneezy and has trouble with watery eyes, but he's getting stronger every day and it's wonderful to see him getting bigger.
