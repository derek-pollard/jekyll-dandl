  - My little rats are very poorly and they are not responding to any medicine. All we can do is keep them warm, spoil them with baby food and hope they will pull through.

Lime and particularly Bramble have been hit really hard by this horrible infection they have. They are both really struggling. having both lost weight and they are cold to the touch. Their energy levels are very low, though I'm please to say Lime's becoming more active again. Bramble has always worried me as he is smaller than his brothers and comes across as more vulnerable. At the moment he is really feeling the cold and when out of his cage will find somewhere on us to snuggle up and share some body heat.

Neither of them are responding to Baytril, so I think we are going to stop giving it to them. Our vet talked to us about an infection called pasturella, and if this is what the rats have then there is no cure. All we will be able to do is take care of our ratties as best as possible and keep them stress free and happy.

We have been feeding them up on baby food, as this will help stop them loosing too much weight and it's nice and warm for them, which is especially nice if they are feel chilly.
