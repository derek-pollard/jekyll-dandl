Our [old guy Chips](/kapy-powy-mango-chips/) was behaving a bit down on his own, so we'd been looking to adopt a couple of rats to be his new family, with no success. On a trip to our local pet store we happened upon some fully grown boys and thought they would be perfect companions for Chips. What we didn't realise were that there were six of them hidden away in various places in the cage! As we were only looking for a couple of rats, I persuaded Derek to let me have three. I felt bad splitting them up like that, but six rats is an awful lot to take care of and I didn't feel I had a cage big enough to house them all. Well that went out the window when I got home and realised what had happened - none of the thee boys were related. All three were completely different in size and colours, you could just see none of them were brothers. Then I started to worry - what if I had split up some siblings. Poor Derek was left with no choice, he had to go back and get the other three and we were really glad he did. Once the second batch of rats were home it became clear that there were three pairs of brothers, and by some fluke I had picked one of each pair. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignleft" width="310" caption="Whisper" class="size-full wp-image-6329" title="Our little rat, Whisper" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/post_2142.jpg" alt="Whisper" height="247" %} 

So, they are all with us now and its lovely to know they are all together safe in their new home. Unfortunately little Whisper is a bit snuffly. I'm hoping that is due to all the stress of leaving the pet store, he seems bright enough if a little unsettled by all the change. The other five seem like a nice, healthy bunch, if a little on the shy side, but I'm sure a bit of attention and some yummy treats will fix that. The most important thing is Chips adores them, and they have welcomed him into their group with not problems at all. If anything I think they are glad to have a happy, confident older rat to show them everything is going to be okay. I don't think the boys have been handled much at the pet store, which is unusual for this particular store as they have always been really good to their animals. Still apart from being jumpy they are sweet guys and I'm looking forward to getting to know them and sharing our meal times with them.
