More rattie drama I'm afraid, this time our sweet Ivy is poorly. She has an infection of her uterus and while she is doing okay, it is still very scary and she will probably need an operation.

It started at the beginning of the year. One night we found her bleeding from her vagina. It was quite scary, but she seemed fine and active, and the bleeding stopped quite quickly. We were worried, but unfortunately at the time life got in the way and as nothing bad seemed to happen we thought she'd be okay without seeing a vet. But she wasn't. Last night she lost a lot of blood and ended up looking very weak and unhappy. We got her straight to the vet this morning and she's been given baytril to help treat her suspected infection. When she's feeling better we'll have to consider surgery to have her spayed to make sure it doesn't happen again.

Ivy is quite a shy girl, but she's also very young, so I think it will be worth the risk to keep her healthy. For now though she's back to her bright and sweet self.
