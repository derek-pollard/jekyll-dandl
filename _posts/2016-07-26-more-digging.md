Fern is heading towards her ninth birthday and after being so poorly just a few months ago we were hoping for a quiet summer with our bunny. No, Fern had other ideas and when I assumed she was snoozing the afternoon away somewhere nice and shady she was actually digging a tunnel, a very long tunnel. I caught a very tired and dirty bunny emerging from her creation and put her back in her cottage for a much needed rest.

To make matters worse Fern made it quite clear she was not going to give up on her tunnel, so Derek and to intervene and fill it back in and cover it with sticks.

We don't really mind Fern digging, she is a bunny after all, its just where she digs. Her current excavation is in her favourite spot along a wall, which seems fine, but she destroys roots as she goes and we quite like our garden the way it is. Plus she was heading towards a fence and who knows where she'd end up if we let her keep going. After one incident where our neighbours bunny was digging its way into our garden, we did not want to return the favour!

Once Derek had blocked off Fern's handiwork she did go back to chilling in the garden and harassing the cats. Still it is a lesson learned, and we will have to keep a close eye on Fern, who knows what she'll get up to next.
