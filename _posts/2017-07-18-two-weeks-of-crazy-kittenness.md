<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8084" title="Our little black kitten, Jessie lounging on her cat post" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/post_4867.jpg" alt="Our little black kitten, Jessie lounging on her cat post" width="390" height="374" />The time has flown with our little kitten. It was a great time for Jessie to join our family, as Derek has been home from work this past two weeks. We have both spent lots of time with our new arrival. As for Jessie she is settling in really well, her confidence and adventurousness has gone through the roof and she is now charging around upstairs at full speed. It is a big house, to a littleÂ cat, and coming from a homing centre I think Jessie has been rather overwhelmed. So, we have been taking things slowly and she's been content with exploring our bedrooms and getting used to all the new sounds and smells.

Her happiness to remain upstairs and still be shut in her room, is working well with Inkie too. It means we have lots of time to introduce the two and make sure everything goes smoothly. I found out, after we got Jessie, that older cats can be reluctant to get to know kittens, because apparently in the wild kittens stay with their mother until they are six months old. This makes the older cat nervous that an angry 'mum cat' may come charging at them at any minute! Whatever Inkie's reservations she is still a little unsure of our new arrival so we are giving her space to get used to the idea. The weather is nice and warm, so Inkie wants to be in the garden most of the day, which leaves the house free for Jessie to explore in her own time.

Things are working out quite nicely and as long as we have no problems introducing Jessie to Inkie, I am confident we will all learn to be one big happy family.
