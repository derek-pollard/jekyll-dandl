Our cat Inkie loves to watch the gerbils (no surprise there), but all our gerbils, both the boys and girls, love to watch Inkie too. Our boys live in our dining room, which has patio doors, so when they are out playing, Inkie can sit and watch them, it also means the boys can watch Inkie too. Many times they will climb up on the frame, right to the glass and look at Inkie, which drives her bonkers. She will reach out and touch the glass and press her little face right to it, even though she will never get her paws on the boys it is an endless game they all seem to enjoy. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Cashew sitting on my knee watching Inkie" class="size-full wp-image-7074" title="Our grey agouti gerbil, Cashew, looking out the patio door" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/post_2994.jpg" alt="Cashew sitting on my knee watching Inkie" height="585" %}
