With all the excitement, and sadness, in our home we have not forgotten about our toothless gerbil, Almond. Unfortunately there is still no sign of his top teeth returning, but he is still a very happy little guy. His brothers are taking really good care of him, keeping him groomed and even being incredibly patient when he gets yummy food to eat. I am so proud of all three of them, they are only little animals after all, but they care for each other so deeply and are looking after each other. Even at play time, Acorn and Cashew are really good with their poorly brother, not being too rough with him and letting him enjoy his baby food, without too much interruption.

It is very difficult to cope with Almond, knowing we are his sole source of food, although we have got into a nice routine of when he wants feeding and how he likes his food. Sometimes he likes large bits of bread other times lots of little bits. Occasionally he will even enjoy some broken up sunflowers. We are getting very good at telling what he wants, how he wants it and when he's had enough. We have always been very close to our gerbils, making sure we sit on the floor with them everyday and play, but have learnt so much about Almond and his tiny little expressions. It is a very speciallyÂ experience, and we are enjoying this important time with our little guy.
