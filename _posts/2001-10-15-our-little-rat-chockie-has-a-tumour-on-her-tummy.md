Chockie has developed a tumour on her tummy; it is the size of a small orange (tangerine size) as Chockie is only a small rat this is quite big. We took her to the vet as soon as we noticed a small lump, the vet informed us that it would be inoperable and the best thing to do is keep her happy. We have moved our little rats into a smaller home and made sure all tubes and shelves are easily accessible for Chockie. It is a very frightening experience for us. However Chockie is taking it all in her stride, after all she doesn't know. Apart from a few problems climbing she is very happy, she looks very cute waddling across the floor. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Chockie and Pipsie enjoying a treat" class="size-full wp-image-6909" title="Our two rats enjoying some kinda surprise" src="/wp-content/uploads/2001/10/post_4122_IMG.jpg" alt="Chockie and Pipsie enjoying a treat" height="505" %}
