<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6632" title="Our cat, Treacle rolling on the floor to say hello to our bunny, Fawn" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/post_4249.jpg" alt="Our cat, Treacle rolling on the floor to say hello to our bunny, Fawn" width="390" height="290" />After the death of his brother, Custard, our other cat, Treacle had started coming upstairs more and of course Fawn was waiting for him. Fawn really loved spending time with Custard and had missed him terribly when he died, so it's been great for Fawn to find a new feline friend.

Treacle wasn't too sure when Fawn first came bounding up to him to say hello, but Fawn is not one to be deterred and he takes every opportunity to spend time with Treacle. We are aware that Fawn's love of our cats means he may be a little lonely, but unless he and Fern sort our their differences and make friends then there is not much we can do about it, but we will keep on trying to get them together.

For now though Fawn has Treacle and they get on very well. Fawn is especially fascinated by Treacle's tail. Custard had quite a stiff stubby tail, but Treacle has a proper cat tail that swishes about. Fawn thinks this is the greatest thing. He will sit behind Treacle and gently sniff his tail, which of course makes Treacle move it ever so slightly. This only makes Fawn more curious and he'll sniff it again. The two go on like this until it all gets too much for Fawn and he goes running off wobbling his ears and bouncing. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Just chillin'" class="size-full wp-image-6633" title="Our bunny, Fawn, with his new feline friend hanging out in our home office" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/post_4248.jpg" alt="Just chillin'" height="455" %} 

They are a very sweet pair, and can't help but bring a smile to our faces.
