We aren't used to getting a lot of snow in our little part of Britain, and especially not at the end of November! Inkie was just getting to grips with the outside world when we woke up to a light covering of snow in the garden and more still falling. It is always a wonderful experience to see your fuzzy family members discover snow for the first time, and Inkie is no different. It was a very excited little cat who we took outside and introduced to snow.

Of course Inkie is fascinated by the way it moves when it kicks up off her paws and has been happily chasing it about and trying to catch it. We're not expecting a deep covering, nor for it to last very long, but as a first experience snow is snow and Inkie thinks it's wonderful. Derek and I aren't so sure though, the lovely white snow makes our little cat look cream!
