Who doesn't like pizza? Not my boys that for sure, and if there is one meal that is sure to get my three guys to join us for dinner it's pizza. The boys cage seems so quiet now there are just the three of them, and it makes us cherish those rare moments when we get to see them all together. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Pika (left corner) Oatie and Maize enjoying some yummy pizza" class="size-full wp-image-6534" title="Our three rats enjoying pizza for dinner" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/post_1755.jpg" alt="Pika (left corner) Oatie and Maize enjoying some yummy pizza" height="410" %}
