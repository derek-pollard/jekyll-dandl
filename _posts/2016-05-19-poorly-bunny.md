<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7514" title="Our bunny, Fern, relaxing on the lawn" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/post_4552.jpg" alt="Our bunny, Fern, relaxing on the lawn" width="390" height="286" />Oh my goodness our sweet, and sometimes bossy, bunny has given us a terrible fright. Only the other day I posted a video of her sitting in a plant pot chomping its contents with not a care in the world.

Then on Tuesday afternoon, only two days later, she'd been out playing as normal and I saw her hop onto the lawn and she just didn't look quite right. At first I thought she'd had a scare, sometimes the cats do something silly and it bothers Fern. So, I ushered her into her cottage and shut her in safe. She still didn't look happy so I kept a close eye on her.

Fern's condition did not improve and as soon as Derek got home, she was panting and looking distressed. I told him what had happened and as we were standing in the kitchen watching Fern through the window, she jumped up into the bed box of her cottage and missed, tumbling back to the floor and looking very confused. It was terrible to see, Fern is normally so agile and the jump to her bed box is nothing compared to the other things she jumps on in the garden. Her cottage had originally come with a ramp to the bed box, which Fern had pulled down when she was younger, so we put that back in place for her in an attempt to help her and made an appointment to see the vet.

Yesterday morning Fern was looking a lot better, although still not her usual self. This was even more evident when she let me pick her up and put her in her travel box, last time I tired to catch her she bit me. Fern is Derek's bunny and she makes sure I know it.

After examining Fern, the vet wanted to keep Fern in for a urine sample, so she could see what was going on with our sweet bunny. As Fern is such a fussy little rabbit and only likes to use the toilet outside, she rarely uses her litter tray when she is brought in for the night, she ended up staying at the vets overnight. It was terrible being without our bunny, especially with her being so poorly. She has never been away from home before, and we could only imagine how scared she was. It was a relief to find out they had finally got the sample from Fern at midday, and I was straight round to collect our little bunny.

Fern was thrilled to be home and back out in her garden and I sent Derek this little video of Fern to let him know she was home safe.

The test results for Ferns urine sample were inconclusive. She had gotten so stressed being kept at the vets it had upset her levels, but our vet thought it was either an infection or diabetes, and she explained Fern is a littleÂ on the chubby side.

We have set about changing Fern's diet with some low fat bunny food, in case she is diabetic. Plus I have to do something about the bird food Fern likes to eat. I put fat balls out for the birds, they are high up in feeders, but the birds do make a mess dropping bits on the floor and Fern likes to munch on it. She has also been given some medicine in case it is an infection, it's not going to be easy convincing Fern to take her medicine, even though she is obviously poorly she is still very strong minded and uncooperative. Still we are going to do everything we can to get our little bunny through this illness.
