It never ceases to amaze me how bright gerbils are. Given a challenging environment gerbils excel at problem solving and learning from each other. After only two days of being in their new cage, all six gerbils have learnt to go in and out by themselves using a wooden ladder hooked to the outside.

Olive was the first one to use the ramp, closely followed by her brother Acorn. Once those two had it sussed, they all started using the ramp. To make it extra special, they also respond to me gently clapping to encourage the to go in, which is very handy with six tiny gerbils charging around.

I am so proud of my little babies, they are so confident and full of fun and adventure and I'm having a fantastic time learning all their personalities. They are growing so quickly at the moment and a few have lost their babyish look and are turning into miniature gerbils. We currently have them out to play two times a day and let them wear themselves out. We also spend plenty of time with them in their cage tempting them with treats and letting them get to know us.
