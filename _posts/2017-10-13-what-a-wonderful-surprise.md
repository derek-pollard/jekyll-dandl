  What a wonderful surprise!

  When we adopted our three little girls, we warned they were a bit nippy. I am very happy to say nothing could be further from the truth. All three girls are so friendly and happy to be in their new home, and we are thrilled to have them.

  Sage and Sundew are the most outgoing of the girls and once they realised they got to come out and run around everyday they went bonkers with excitement. I can't tell you how lovely it was too see. There was so much rattie bouncing and playing, they even wanted to play with us. Ivy took things a little slower, than her sisters, but she too has ventured to onto the floor and is running around. She may not be as confident, or bouncy, as Sage and Sundew, but she loves to sneak around under the bed and see what mischief she can find.

  As for living with our other six rats, I'm not sure that is going to happen. There is a little tension there, nothing horrible, but I don't think leaving them alone together would be wise. As it is we let them out at the same time, the six girls in the office and these three in our bedroom and they can go and find each other if they want. We have the odd squabble, but it is broken up easily. Everyone seems happy with the arrangement and so are Derek and I. Time will tell if their relationship improves, but we don't want anything upsetting the harmony for our six girls.

  Everything has worked out so well, we have been very fortunate, and even though I wasn't sure I'd have enough time to devote to our new arrivals they have fitted in perfectly. They come out twice a day, get a yummy treat of fresh bread at tea time and seem to happily sleep the day away :-).
