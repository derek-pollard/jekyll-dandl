I am very sad to say that our beautiful boy Powy has passed away. We don't really know what happened, Powy was a happy, healthy, if slightly nippy rat and he slipped away without warning. We found him yesterday curled up in his bed like he'd just fallen asleep and not woken up, he was such a lovely guy we really are going to miss him. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Powy in his favourite place" class="size-full wp-image-6426" title="Our beautiful rat Powy snuggled up with his three rattie brothers" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/post_3568.jpg" alt="Powy in his favourite place" height="392" %}
