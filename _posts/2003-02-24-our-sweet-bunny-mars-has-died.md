Mars was still a chirpy little chap enjoying being a house bunny, he wasn't going to let anything stop him having fun. Sadly this evening he took a sudden turn for the worse, we rushed him to the vet, but it was little Mars's time to go and he died in Derek's arms.

Compared to his brother, Jupiter, Mars was a little crazy and unpredictable. He'd often growl at us and give a little lunge for no reason, but that was just part of his charm. Together the boys were complete opposites, but that's what made them so special. They brought our garden to life with their funny bunny antics, helping with the gardening and those beautiful bunny faces.

It is very hard to say goodbye to Mars, after seven wonderful years of his troublesome ways. Mars and Jupiter were Derek's first ever bunnies and now they are both gone, it's the end of an era. Both bright eyed, cheeky little chaps will live forever in our hearts and on this web page.
