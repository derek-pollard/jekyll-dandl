As is becoming the story of my life, I was at the pet store picking up supplies when I caught sight of these two gorgeous husky rats. Next to Agoutis, husky rats are irresistible to me, especially when I have empty rat cages, and an old lonely rat missing his brothers, at home.

So, two super gorgeous little boys have joined our family. I've names our new guys Kapy and Powy, or the Kappow Brothers. There's something about these too that makes me think they are going to be trouble when they get older, and their names seems to fit that. They both have very distinctive markings, so it's nice and easy to tell them apart, and of course I am really looking forward to watching their fur fade as they grow.

I'm pleased to say introducing them to our old guy Panda has been incredibly easy. The new guys are more than happy exploring their new home, they've been to see Panda and he ignored them, so they moved on to more interesting things. At the moment Panda is trying to act all aloof, sitting up in his hammock while the new guys charge around the cage and explore everything - except Panda's hammock - but Panda's not fooling anyone, and I'm sure he's actually quite interested in the little rats who are clambering around his cage. I do think the age difference is working in our favour, Panda is a bit too old to be interested in the crazy young rats, and they are to young and excitable to worry about Panda. The most important thing is there is lots of room for everyone to do their own thing. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Powy" class="size-full wp-image-6405" title="Our new husky rat, Powy sitting on his cage door" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/post_3445.jpg" alt="Powy" height="298" %} 

Being the troublesome little spirits that I think they are, they have taken no time at all to settle in and are very adventurous. Only time will tell if I'm right about what little devils they're going to be and whether they will grow in to their names. Whatever their personalities, Derek and I are going to have a lot of fun getting to know them.
