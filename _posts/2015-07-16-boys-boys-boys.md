If you have been following the saga of our new [baby gerbils](/gerbils/cherry-plum-olive/) you will already know how we ended up with these three little cuties. At the moment they are happily living with their sisters, and will for a week or two yet. They are gorgeous, healthy little gerbils, just like their sisters, and we are already seeing their personalities shine through. Like the girls they have no fear of coming out to play and running around, though catching six gerbils is a little tricky.

The boys mirror their sisters colouring in that Acorn and Almond are both Agouti and Cashew is a grey agouti. While they are all together it makes identifying them a bit of a challenge, but we are coping as best we can.
