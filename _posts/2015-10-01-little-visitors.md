I've been suffering from a cold these past few days and I wanted nothing more than a quiet sit down in the dining room and to play on my 3DS. With my three little boys living in the dining room there is not such thing as a quiet sit down, and as soon as they spotted me they wanted out! As I can't refuse my boys anything (or their sisters for that matter) I popped their cage on the floor and left them to their own devices while I resumed my quiet sit down.

Normally when I let my gerbils out I sit on the floor with them, which helps us get to know each other and makes me a large climbing frame for the gerbils to play on. Not ones to be put off by me not feeling well, my gerbils decided they would just visit me in my chair (and stop me playing my game!)
