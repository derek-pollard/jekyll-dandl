He'd been moping around quite a bit, not really wanting to leave his bed, or eat and drink. We've been giving him attention and cuddles, but we can't make up for the fun of having some little rattie friends to share his home with. We had not planned to get more rats, but fate intervened while on a trip to the pet shopÂ when we spotted [two super cute little husky boys](/kapy-powy-mango-chips/). How could we resist?

We don't expect the new arrivals to replace Panda's brothers, and they haven't, but Panda looks a lot brighter since they moved into his home. Mostly Panda sits up in his hammock and watches the chaos below, and the new boys know to stay away from the grumpy old rat :-) The important thing is that Panda is being much more active, he's coming down to eat and drink and wanting to come out and play too. Panda is such a sweet old guy, I'm not anticipating any trouble between the rats, though I will keep and eye out to make sure Panda doesn't get trampled in all the baby rattie excitement. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Panda and Powy" class="size-full wp-image-10005" title="Senior rat, Panda and his baby brother, Powy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/post_3421.jpg" alt="Panda and Powy" height="441" %} 

We will keep monitoring Panda, but I'm really hopeful that our new additions are going to continue to have a very positive effect on him.
