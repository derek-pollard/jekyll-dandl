About a week ago we noticed Custard was moping round the house a bit and was off his food and generally not looking very happy. We took him straight to the vets who couldn't find anything obviously wrong with him, other than being dehydrated. He gave Custard an injection to help settle his tummy, and some sachets for us to mix into Custard's drinking water to help rehydrate him.

As Custard wasn't interested in drinking, I had to syringe the fluids into his mouth. He wasn't very interested in eating either, even when we tried to feed him fancy cat food. It was very difficult to see him like that, as Custard was normally such a greedy little cat who would happily eat his brothers share of any food going. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignleft" width="390" caption="Lindsay and Custard in happier times" class="size-full wp-image-6577 " title="Our cat Custard having a cuddle with Lindsay" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/post3280_IMG.jpg" alt="Lindsay and Custard in happier times" height="394" %} 

We took him back to the vets two days later and while the fluids I was getting into him were doing him some good he still wouldn't eat. The vet had a good feel of Custard's tummy and was concerned he could feel some thickening in his intestine. We were given some more things to try in order to get Custard eating again, including some yucky green paste that was designed to line Custard's stomach and help with any tummy upset he may have.

Sadly when we went for our final check up custard had lost more weight, and he was still only drinking what I syringed into him. Custard's weight loss meant the vet could get a better feel of Custard's insides and a better feel of the mass he had felt before.

It was a very difficult decision to let Custard go, but we talked it though with our vet and he advised us it was the best thing for our sweet cat. We're both kind of numb right now and I have no idea what a home without Custard is going to be like.
