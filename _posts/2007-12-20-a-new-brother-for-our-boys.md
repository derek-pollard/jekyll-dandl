There has not been very much to say about Toffee and Caramel over the past year. They have both grown into rather large happy boys, who like to do nothing! Honestly we struggle to get them to play out of their cage. Even during cleaning out time the silly lumps just wait to go back in. Still if that is what makes them happy, I'm not going to force them out - even though I would love to play with them everyday.

We'd recently adopted an older pair of ratties from the RSPCA, Minty and Rummy. Sadly Rummy was very poorly and passed away, leaving his brother all alone. So it seemed only right, that our two big cuddly old guys would have room in their home and hearts for a very sweet and lonely guy called, Minty.

Both Toffee and Caramel are both extremely soft and good natured boys. This meant that we didn't have any of the fights that can sometimes happen when you try to introduce fully grown male rats to each other. In fact no real introductions were made we just put the guys on the floor together, then into a freshly cleaned out cage. With the exception of keeping a close eye on them for signs of stress or fighting, we left them to it. While this is definitely not recommended for all rats, we know Toffee and Caramel very well, and Minty was a obviously a very sweet boy.

So far it seems everyone is happy with the new arrangement. Toffee and Caramel are happy that they are still getting lots of yummy treats and Minty is glad of the company of other rats.

No one wants to come our and play, but it is lovely to see the boys all cuddled up happily together.
