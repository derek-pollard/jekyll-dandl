I'm very relieved to say Max is well on the way to making a full recovery. He still gets a little tired at play time, but he is eating, drinking and running around like nothing much happened. It was so so difficult seeing little Max so poorly and not knowing how to help him, but thank goodness he is bouncing back now.

One odd thing we noticed though is that Max won't use his old water bottle. He was drinking fine before he was taken ill, we change his water every night and pay attention to how much the boys drink, but when he started to feel better he wouldn't touch it. Fortunately I have lots of spare water bottles in the house, and I gave him a second bottle and he went straight to it. We kept seeing him go to the old bottle like he was thirsty, but he would not drink. As soon as that second bottle was there he had a huge drink.

I don'tÂ think his illness was dehydration, as he was still peeing, but he was so poorly he'd tinkle in bed and have to move afterwards, and his water had been going down normally until he was ill. I can only assume something upset him about his water bottle. Not that I'm worried about that now, he has a new water bottle and is looking so much better and brighter. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Max feeling much better" class="size-full wp-image-8506" title="Our degu May sitting on a wooden perch" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/post_6118.png" alt="Max feeling much better" height="452" %}
