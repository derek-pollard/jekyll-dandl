Treacle and Custard were not very impressed when we first put our house up for sale and people kept coming round to view it. Then when we started packing up our belongings their mood did not improve. Most of the time Custard was amusing, wrapping himself in bubble wrap or just sitting on whatever we were trying to pack. Treacle was another story, he would wander around the house crying and there were several times we found him standing on top of the stack of boxes. Due to all the disruption we decided to put the cats in our local cattery sooner rather than later. They spent four days away from home before the move, we did miss them but it made life a lot easier not tripping over them all the time.

On day of the move the morning was spent hanging around while the removals men finished loading the van. Lindsay had the job of collecting the cats, her car is a bit more practical than Derek's. So with three rats in a carry box on the passenger seat, two gerbils in their tank on the back seat she went to pick up the cats. Treacle and Custard were not very impressed with being in the cat box and were already crying by the time they got out to the car. Lindsay had to drive for over an hour with a car full of animals and Treacle and Custard crying in the boot. To say her nerves were a little frayed when they arrived in Ipswich was and understatement. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="The house may have changed, but the beds as comfortable as ever" class="size-full wp-image-6572" title="Our two cats asleep on our bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/post_4983.jpg" alt="The house may have changed, but the beds as comfortable as ever" height="505" %} 

Once at our new house we had to stash the cats somewhere while the removal men unloaded the van, so we shut them in the bathroom and let them out of their cat box. Being responsible cat owners we had the cat loo ready in the car, so with some food and a bowl of water the cats had everything they could need. No the cats were still not very impressed, the wanted us in there with them. And every time Custard heard us moving about outside the bathroom door he began crying again.

Once the removal men where gone we let the cats out of the bathroom. Custard was thrilled to see us and followed us around the house. Treacle was not so thrilled, to begin with he did not want to leave the bathroom. When he plucked up the courage to leave the bathroom, he went into one of the bedrooms and hid behind a box. Moving their food to the kitchen, soon persuaded Treacle to explore the rest of the house.

After a few days of exploring the house we let the cats outside. Again Treacle was not very happy and went charging back inside, hiding under the bed. The next day was a bit more successful and the cats left the garden. Unfortunately for us all was not plain sailing. We had planned to fit a cat flap to the back door, as this is what the cats are used to. When we came to examine the back door we found it was made of metal and there is no way Derek would be able to saw out a hole to fit the cat flap through. At the moment we are considering many options, from getting a new back door to fitting the cat flap through an external wall of the house. For now Lindsay is having to let the cats in and out, we have built up a routine and for the moment the cats are happy. We are sure as the hot weather arrives things will change and the cats won't be quite so agreeable.
