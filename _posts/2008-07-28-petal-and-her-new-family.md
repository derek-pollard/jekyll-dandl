Mondays are rattie clean out day - that's all 4 rat cages. I took the opportunity to let Petal, Daisy, Peach and Apricot play together while I cleaned out their cages. Because Daisy and her daughters are so young I had moved them into Petal's big cage and put her in a smaller cage. It wasn't ideal, but seeing as they seemed to be getting along I didn't think it would take to long before they were all living together.

While I was cleaning out the big cage, that Daisy shares with her daughters, they all pilled into Petal's cage. Seeing as Petal didn't seem to mind, I left them to it. Mind you once Petal discovered the girls food bowl sitting on the sofa she busied herself with nicking their food and trying to hide it all over the sofa. That's my Petal!

Once the big cage was back in place, and seeing as Daisy, Peach and Apricot were messing around in her home, Petal moved into the big cage and made herself at home. I had to turf the little rats out of Petal's cage, so I could clean that out and they happily trundled off back to their cage to see what I had done. None of them seemed to notice Petal had moved in, they were too busy climbing the bars and seeing what I'd changed and Petal was happy eating. So I left them to it while I cleaned Petal's home out, and by the time I was finished they were all fast asleep. I didn't have the heart to wake them so I left them to it.

They all seem happy with the new arrangement, so I have my fingers crossed that they'll all continue to get on. It will be lovely for Petal to have a rattie family all of her own. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Petal, Daisy, Peach & Apricot" class="size-full wp-image-7662" title="Our four rats exploring their new cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/post_1910.jpg" alt="Petal, Daisy, Peach & Apricot" height="417" %}
