Oh Jessie is a sweet girl. Derek and I will be collecting two new additions to our family this afternoon and to ensure they settle in and feel safe, we've prepared a room just for them.

Keen to prove just what a good big sister she will make Jessie is helping with the preparations and checking all the toys are kitten safe.
