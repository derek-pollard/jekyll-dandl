The guys were pretty down after the death of their brother Powy, but I'm really pleased to say things have slowly got back to normal with them I'm sure they still miss him, as do I, but I think they've sorted themselves out and I'm pleased to say much silliness has resumed in their cage.

It's not the greatest picture in the world, but it shows the love the boys have for each other. Rather than fighting with Chips, Kapy is actually grooming him and Chips is one of those rats who rolls over at the slightest provocation. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Kapy and Chips being silly" class="size-full wp-image-6428" title="Our rat Kapy tussling with Chips" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/post_0002.jpg" alt="Kapy and Chips being silly" height="306" %}
