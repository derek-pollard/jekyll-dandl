Our precious, and rather bossy, Sundew passed away last night and we found her this morning looking very peaceful in her bed. She had been out trundling around just before bed, early morning and bedtimes have always been her favourite play times, and she seemed very happy. Then like I say, we found her first thing this morning, looking at peace. I can't say it wasn't a shock, because we had both hoped for a little longer with our sweet girl, but as I'd said before she was ageing gracefully and we knew, though she'd only been with us a relatively short time, she was a very old girl. Both Derek and I feel quite lost without her, however it is always such a lovely thing to see your little rats through to old age and a peaceful passing.

Sundew was one of those amazing little rats who knew exactly what she wanted out of life. I still remember when I was first getting to know them, I let Sundew, Sage and Ivy out on the landing. I didn't want to risk anyone disappearing under the furniture. That was fine for Sundew on the first day, but the next day she was not happy, refusing to even leave the cage. Not wanting to see my new little rat so unhappy, I opened our bedroom door and she was off like a shot. Sundew did a thorough exploration of our bedroom and then came trundling back to me all happy. From that day on she had the full run of our house, not that she was very interested in going downstairs. Sage and Ivy weren't quite so adventurous, though Sage had her moments when she'd follow Sundew for a mini adventure.

I will never understand how anyone could give away any rats, never mind three such amazing girls. Still it was an amazing gift to us and I can only hope we made our three girls half as happy as they made us.
