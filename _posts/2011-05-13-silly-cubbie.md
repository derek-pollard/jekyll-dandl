What can I say, our silly boy Cubbie is still skulking round the garden, but at least he's having a bit more fun. It's amazing to see him outside, especially as summer approaches. Being bundled out the back door by Derek wasn't the most graceful of introductions to the garden, but it worked and Cubbie loves it.

As you can see, Cubbie is still prowling around the garden like a big monster is going to jump out at him at any moment, but he's having fun and that is the most important thing.
