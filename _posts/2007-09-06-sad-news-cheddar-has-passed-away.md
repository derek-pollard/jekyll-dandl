I'm sorry to say our amazing little gerbil Cheddar passed away peacefully. When I say amazing I really do mean it. Since the end of last year, Cheddar had been having problems with his teeth. His front top teeth had just stopped growing, but his bottom ones had not. This gave us two problems the first was that he needed to have his bottom teeth clipped regularly by our vet and the second was that he could not eat normal gerbil food. We love Cheddar very, very much so we got into a nightly routine of breaking up his gerbil food into small bite sized pieces for him.

Amazingly given his age, the loss of his brother and his inability to chew, an important gerbil activity, Cheddar survived for another ten wonderful months. He still enjoyed coming out every night to run around for at least half an hour. He would climb up the furniture and our legs to come and see us and steal the food we were preparing for him.

Cheddar was around three years of age, which is an incredible age for any gerbil never mind one with no teeth, when he slipped away peacefully one evening. We miss him very much, but are very proud of the care we took of our little guy and the bond we shared with him.
