I really don't know what to say. Lime had been very poorly even as a baby, along with his brothers Bramble and Apple and sisters, Peach and Apricot, and our vets were flummoxed at first. Though they all did recover from this initial illness when we first adopted them, they have been ill on and off over the time we have had them. We think all of the siblings may have an immune deficiency that leaves them open to infections. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Lime and Apple" class="size-full wp-image-8990" title="My rats, Lime and Apple enjoying a treat on our dining room table" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/post_4010.jpg" alt="Lime and Apple" height="555" %} 

Both Lime and his brother Apple were taken ill again a few months back. They both started loosing weight and energy. We immediately started giving them both baby food to help keep their weight up and while this helped at first, Lime's appetite started to decline over the past week and he became very dehydrated. He didn't want to take any fluids and even the amount of baby food he'd eat started to shrink. It was a difficult decision but we took Lime to the vets and had him put to sleep rather than let him waste away and suffer.

Apple is still struggling on and we can only hope that the loss of Lime won't affect him and his brother Bramble too badly.
