Our two cats are now at the age where they’re not very interested in chasing smaller animals, if anything they just want to sleep and our bunnies can sense it.

Custard likes to sleep in our spare bedroom and as Fawn has the run of the upstairs, it was inevitable the two were going to meet. At first Fawn was a bit nervous of Custard and he would run and hide in his own room, and Custard would just ignore him and go to bed.

Overtime Fawn has got braver. It started off with him not running all the way into his room and just hanging around in the doorway. Then he started standing his ground on the landing, but when Custard went to sniff him he’d run off.

I’m not sure when it happened, but now the two of them spend a lot of time sitting together on the landing. We will often find them at the top of the stairs just sitting side by side as though it is the most normal thing in the world.

I know cats and rabbits have got on before, but these two being friends did surprise us. Our previous bunnies, Mars & Jupiter, never liked either of our cats and Fawn is such a nervous little bunny as well.

It is nice that Fawn has found a friend and that we no longer have to worry about him being afraid of the cats. Well I say cats, he hasn’t met our other cat Treacle yet.
