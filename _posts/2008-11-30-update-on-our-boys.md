Our vet is pretty much convinced the rats have pasturella. He explained that, over time, any bouts of illness will gradually wear the little guys down until they get too weak to recover. The best we can do is take care of them, and make sure they are happy. We don’t know what that means for their long-term health, but for now they appear to be through the worst of it, and for that we are grateful. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Lime and Bramble trying to sneak past me" class="size-full wp-image-8986" title="My two rats, Lime and Bramble sneaking out the room" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/post_3913.jpg" alt="Lime and Bramble trying to sneak past me" height="314" %} 

Lime has improved the most out of the boys. His breathing is silent now and he’s put the weight he lost back on, you wouldn’t know he’d been ill. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="470" caption="Apple up to no good" class="size-full wp-image-8987" title="My rat, Apple attacking my slipper" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/post_2266.jpg" alt="Apple up to no good" height="256" %} 

Bramble is still the smallest of the three boys, but he has put some weight back on, I guess he is just a little rat. Not that his brothers are particularly big rats, but then neither are their mum, Daisy, or their sisters. Unfortunately he still wheezes quite a lot, but it’s weird he’s not ill. He has no difficulty running around, fighting, climbing and jumping. He has gone back to being very active, if anything he is now the most mischievous one of the bunch. Nothing he does leaves him out of breath; he just has this squeaky wheezy breathing.

It’s great news for us, as we were really scared what was going to happen to our little family of rats. I know we still don’t know what is going to happen, but for now we can go back to enjoying our guys and making the most of whatever time we have with them
