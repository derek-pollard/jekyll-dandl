<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7843" title="Our gerbil, Almond eating bread next to half a loaf of bread" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/post_4536.jpg" alt="Our gerbil, Almond eating bread next to half a loaf of bread" width="470" height="529" />We had to rush poor little Almond to the vet this afternoon. He was out playing and eating lots of bread and baby food, as is becoming the way while we wait for his teeth to grow back. When he'd finished with the bit of bread he was eating, I noticed it had blood on it. I was terrified and scooped up my little boy to check he was okay. It wasn't an awful lot of blood, but gerbils are so tiny you can't take any chances.

Seeing he wasn't in any distress I let him go and called Derek, who arranged to come home from work and take Almond to the vet. He was looking much better by the time Derek got him, but we still took him for a check-up anyway. As we have things under control, the vet didn't offer much advice, but he did trim down Almond's bottom teeth to help protect his top gums, and because there is nothing for them to wear against.

Almond was understandably upset after his trip to the vet, but he has settle down well and is back to coming to us for food several times a day. He is a very brave boy, gerbils have such tiny stomaches, but Almond understands to eat as much as he can at feeding times. We have got into a nice routine of giving him four feeds a day. His favourite feed is at tea time, when he gets super fresh bread not long out the bread machine :-). We are still hopeful his teeth will come back, even so Almond seems in good spirits, and though he can't chew cardboard he's still enjoying coming out to run around and squabble with his brothers.
