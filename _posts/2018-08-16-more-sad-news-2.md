I'm afraid we lost our little Lilac last night. We knew she was struggling with her respiratory infection, but we were still hopeful she could pull through. Sadly it wasn't meant to be.

I was feeding my girls at bedtime and Lilac had a few yogurt drops and then wanted to come out of the cage. I couldn't really let her as I needed to feed my other girls, and our cat Jessie was around. Normally I wouldn't worry to much about Jessie, she usually gets chased by the rats, but in Lilac's frail state I didn't want to take any chances. So I picked her out of theÂ cage, thinking she could help me, I wrapped her in a towel to keep her safe and the next thing I knew she had gone limp. It was a horrible shock she didn't appear distressed, other than wanting to leave the cage, and I really wasn't prepared to say goodbye. As sad and unexpected as it was I was at least I was with her and I know she went peacefully.

We are going to miss both her and Jasmine for a long time.
