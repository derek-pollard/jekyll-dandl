Things hadn't quiet gone to plan with [our six silly guys](/pika-chewie-maize-oatie-whisper-truffle/) and while I love taking care of them I do miss having some playful rats in my home and when Derek and I happened across these two gorgeous boys it seemed like it was meant to be. Normally I find husky rats irresistible, but I guess with my other boys being a terrible bunch of hermits I was worried about getting some more cage loving rats, and wasn't sure what to do. FortunatelyÂ Derek knows me to well, and he wouldn't take no for an answer. So, leaving me outside at the car he went to find out more about the gorgeous rats we had seen.

The first thing Derek discovered is there's nothing shy or timid about these two, even before he'd put his hand in their tank they were up and about putting on a silly show for him. There had been a large wooden tunnel in there tank and they climbed up on it and started shoving each other to see who their new visitor was first, and when he did put his hand in they just wanted fuss, Derek was sold and these two handsome boys have joined our family. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignleft" width="390" caption="Wombat" class="size-full wp-image-6357" title="Our new husky rat, Wombat" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/post_2739.jpg" alt="Wombat" height="261" %} 

Once home and completely unfazed by the journey, Derek amused our new guys while I put the finishing touches to their new home. These guys are going to live in our office and will have lots to explore, but first they were more excited to discover where they were going to live. The guys were straight in their cage, and from all the exploring and rearranging it seems like they are very happy.

From what we can tell Bandit is the more confident of the two, not that Wombat is particularly timid, but so far Bandit has been the first to get into everything, which explains his name. Wombat is the more considered of the two, and while I know all that can change his name suits him very well. They are such beautiful boys and I am sure we are going to have lots of wonderful adventures together.
