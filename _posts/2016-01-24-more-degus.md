It's the same old story I'm afraid, yesterday morning we popped into the pet store for supplies and there were two super cute little Degus putting on a show for us. How could we resist? Well actually we had to as we'd gone on our bicycles, not very practical for transporting little animals, so we walked away empty handed. Once home we had a big talk about adding more degus to our family. To be honest cage wise we are a bit full, but because some of my rats are a bit old and don't want to come out and play as much I have a lot of time on my hands and I love caring for small animals. Plus [our first degu, Max](/max/) is all on his own. Degus are very social animals and even though introducing degus can be a long and tricky process, we thought it only fair to give Max a chance to have some degu brothers in his life. And so it was decided and later in the afternoon we popped back to the pet store in our car and came home with two new additions for our family. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Roo behind Pip enjoying a snack" class="size-full wp-image-7334" title="Our two degus sitting next to each other eating" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/post_4298.jpg" alt="Roo behind Pip enjoying a snack" height="539" %} 

At the moment the boys are living in our office, on Derek's desk in front of his computer of all places! When they are more settled we will move them downstairs, and we can begin the process of introducing them to Max. Compared to Max they are very chattery little guys. Where Max took a good week before he started chattering at us, these two are constantly wittering at each other when they think no one is around. In fact that is how Pip got his name. Last night he woke us up in the middle of the night squeaking his little head off. We rushed to check on him, but everything was fine, in fact our rats and gerbils, who also live in the office, were fast asleep until we woke them all up. Fortunately Pip's squeaking didn't go on for too long and we were all able to go back to sleep, but in the morning Derek said how the pattern of Pip's squeaking had reminded him of the pips our smoke alarm does when it's battery is getting low and that is how little Pip earned his name. Roo is named after a character from the Winnie the Pooh stories, I thought it fitted nicely with Pip.

For now the boys are playful, but a bit nervous when we get too close. It's all been a big change for them so we are happy to give them time to settle in and feel safe.
