It is with very, very sad hearts we said goodbye to Topaz this morning. Her tumours were starting to interfere with her quality of life and we were seeing a decline in her strength and personality. Right up until this point Topaz has not been letting anything get in her way. She was still the craziest of her sisters, the first to get into trouble and sound the rattie alarm for everyone to join her in her mischief. She had a huge personality and love of life and we are going to miss her terribly.

This sad day leaves us with just our sweet Ruby and chunky Opal. We don't know how being without their two more outgoing sisters will affect them, but we will do everything we can to make this transition as easy as possible on them.
