I'm very sad to say that today I said goodbye to little Pip. Our last degu had been slowing down gradually with age and nearly a week ago he started letting me pick him out of bed at night to give him his medicine. After years of him charging out and then running rings around me it was quite strange. I didn’t worry though as otherwise he was happy and active, regularly up and about in his home playing in his wheel and flying saucer. It just seemed part of him ageing gracefully. 

Then at lunchtime play on Saturday, after having his dust bath Pip did something different. He jumped up on my legs, walked up them towards me and had some fuss, just like he he used to with Lindsay. He then just sat there and I don’t know why but I scooped him up and held him in my hands against my jumper. Pip has always been a friendly guy but not big on being picked up, preferring fuss instead. He didn’t complain, in fact he stayed there quietly for over twenty minutes when I had to go to an appointment. He seemed happy to go back in his home.

That night when it was time to give him his medicine he was up but not doing anything. He took his medicine but wasn't very responsive and dribbled some. He didn't feel right in my hands and wasn't interested in running around. I rumpled up the towel I was holding him with next to his food bowl and popped him in to be comfortable, hoping he would pick up and head off to bed in his own time.

Next morning he had moved around but was still in the towel. Despite being covered up he was very cold so I transferred him to a pet carrier and included a heat pad under the towel to warm him up. Throughout the day I checked on him and syringed a little water into him but he was very limp and unresponsive. It was difficult to see such a lively active little character like that and each time I checked on him I wondered if he would still be with me.

This morning Pip was no better so I thought it best to take him to the vets and say goodbye. He had reached a good age, especially with being on long-term pain relief, and it seemed the kindest thing to do for him. 

Pip was an amazing guy, full of life and mischief. Even with all the troubles of his condition and the need for daily medication didn't stop him being a friendly, affectionate and playful little friend to us both. The dining room is so empty now after over six years of it being the degu's room. It just isn't the same without the sound of his wheel or flying saucer going day and night, and without him yelling out every time someone comes to the front door. Even Pebble, one the kittens, has been looking for him and crying out as they used to greet each other, often at breakfast. I'm pleased though that he a had a good long life full of happy times and felt that he knew he was loved.
