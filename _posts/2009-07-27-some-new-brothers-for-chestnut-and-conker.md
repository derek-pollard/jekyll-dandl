After the very sad loss of our [ratties Pepper & Pippin](/pepper-pippin/), we couldn't face keeping Chestnut and Conker in their old cage in their old room. It was too much of a sad reminder of our much loved boys who had left us far too quickly, so we decided to move them.

Our three boys [Apple, Bramble and Lime are very friendly rats](/apple-bramble-lime/), if a little bonkers and while they do have their health problems we know from their sisters that it is nothing contagious. Plus with Chestnut and Conker being so timid and shy and having trouble understand that they are allowed to leave their cage to run about and play, we think it will do them good to have some confident and energetic brothers. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Chestnut and Conker meeting their new brothers" class="size-full wp-image-8960" title="Four rats playing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/post_0282.jpg" alt="Chestnut and Conker meeting their new brothers" height="514" %} 

Apple is obviously boss rat over his brothers and he made a little show of puffing himself up and being all aggressive when he first met Chestnut and Conker, but they weren't very impressed and it all died down fairly quickly, which meant the guys were all able to move in together very quickly.

So far everything is working out well. Chestnut and Conker obviously haven't been handled very much, if at all, and as expected having three new brothers who are happy to come charging out of their cage and run around is helping htem find their confidence. It will take time for them to trust Derek and me and get used to being picked up and cuddled, but for now we are happy to see them start exploring their new surroundings. They are even starting to show a bit of interest in us when we walk into the room, yes they want food, but it is a start :-).
