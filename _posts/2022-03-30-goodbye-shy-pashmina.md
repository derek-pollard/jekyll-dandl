In February I discovered a lump on Pashmina’s neck and started checking for it growing in size. The location and her age didn’t make removal much of an option, especially with her being such a shy and sensitive girl, but I still wanted to watch for issues. Although it seemed to appear quite quickly I was still hopeful that she might get to grow old naturally before it became a problem to her. 

Unfortunately it grew the quickest I have see of all our rats with tumours. It didn’t seem to cause Pashmina any pain or discomfort so I continued to check her every day and make sure she was happy, which she soon got to expect and enjoy. Sadly the lump reached a size that started making it difficult for her to wash her face on one side and she had to eat one handed. So I decided to take her to the vets to say goodbye before there were any unpleasant consequences or she became distressed. That morning I gave her some treats, she enjoyed the extra attention and slept very soundly for a couple of hours until the appointment. 

Pashmina was the shyest of the whole family, in the beginning often preferring to stay inside sleeping during playtimes. She was always sweet and very gentle, rather than nervous, preferring a simple life. Then after she was poorly and needed medication everything changed. Instead of being given the medication making her withdraw, she took it as affection and bonded with me - I was very honoured. She remained the most reserved of her family but would come out at playtimes and visit me. I will miss our gentle Pashmina. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Pashmina enjoying milkshake before her lump became large" class="size-full wp-image-10453" title="Pashmina enjoying milkshake before her lump became large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/post_2939.jpg" alt="Pashmina enjoying milkshake before her lump became large" height="585" %}
