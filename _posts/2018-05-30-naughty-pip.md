I am very happy to say Pip is looking much better. His wound is all healed up and he is out of that awful collar. The skin healing cream did the trick, that and Pip not being able to mess with his wound. At the moment we are too relieved to be mad at him, the thought of his leg not healing was terrifying. Still it's over now and hopefully we can go back to having fun with out little degu. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Jessie and Pip at playtime" class="size-full wp-image-8484" title="Our black cat, Jessie, relaxing with Pip the degu" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/post_6101.jpg" alt="Jessie and Pip at playtime" height="437" %}
