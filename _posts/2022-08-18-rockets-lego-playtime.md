My Australian friend Alison sent me a lovely birthday gift of some Lego flowers. What better time to make a start than on a hot summer afternoon to stay out of the sun. It wasn't long before Rocket turned up to help as cats do like to join and provide their own unique assistance.

It would be easy to imagine this resulted in chaos with pieces scattered, chewed and stollen. That wasn't the case with sweet little Rocket, he was actually very careful and gentle. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Rocket wanted to make sure all the pieces were present" class="size-full wp-image-10524" title="Rocket wanted to make sure all the pieces were present" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/rocket-lego-playtime2.jpg" alt="Rocket wanted to make sure all the pieces were present" height="705" %} {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Being so helpful was very tiring" class="size-full wp-image-10522" title="Being so helpful was very tiring" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/post_5455.jpg" alt="Being so helpful was very tiring" height="405" %}
