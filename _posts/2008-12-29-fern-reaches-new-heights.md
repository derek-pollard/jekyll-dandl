Our little bunny is obviously not going to stop amazing us or finding new ways to get into mischief. At the end of our garden we have a picnic table, which is meant to be a nice place for Derek and me to sit and enjoy our garden. Thanks to Fern it ended up being a place to put potted plants to keep them out of her way and stop her eating them. While Fern had climbed on the picnic table a couple of times when she was younger, she never looked very happy, and we had thought the plants were safe there. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Fern the explorer" class="size-full wp-image-6305" title="Our bunny Fern on top of a picnic table" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/post_3475.jpg" alt="Fern the explorer" height="437" %} 

Because its winter and the garden is looking quite damp and drab and not a very exciting place for an adventurous bunny. Fern has rekindled her interest in the picnic table. No longer is she afraid of being so high up and vulnerable, if anything she seems to love it and has even gone up on the table and chased our cat down. Of course she has also discovered the plants that we'd put up there and is able to chomp them at will. Who knows what she is going to do next.
