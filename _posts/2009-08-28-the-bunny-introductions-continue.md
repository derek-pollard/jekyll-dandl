Fern and Fawn may carry on like they hate each other, well its actually Fern who terrorises Fawn, but the end result is the same, they don't get on.

Not to be deterred, Derek and I are persevering and trying to get the two used to each other. Summer is here and we are taking full advantage of it. The biggest problem we have with our two bunnies is Fern likes to be outside during the day, and gets very cross if we bring her in before bedtime â€“ and then when we do bring her in at night only wants to go to bed. So actually getting the two bunnies together has been a problem. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="'Not you again!'" class="size-full wp-image-6629" title="Our two dwarf bunnies, Fern and Fawn facing off through a metal fence" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/post_4992.jpg" alt="'Not you again!'" height="357" %} {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="'Has she gone?'" class="size-full wp-image-6630" title="Our dwarf bunny, Fawn exploring the garden" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/post_5076.jpg" alt="'Has she gone?'" height="345" %} 

With the warm weather we have been able to take Fawn outside. We bought him a metal bunny run, that is made up of metal sections that clip together to make an pentagon. This keeps him safe from Fern, but they can sniff each other. Fern does try to bite Fawn though the bars, but she can't really get to him. When Fern has had enough she goes back in her run, of her own accord, and we'll shut her in and let Fawn out to play. This works out really well. Unfortunately we got over confident and let the two bunnies out at the same time and Fern went nuts, as usual, leaving Fawn upset.

The summer is nearly over now and we are no closer to getting the bunnies together. I don't think it will be fair on Fawn to drag him outside in the cold weather, as he is very much a soft, cuddly, house bunny, boy.

I guess all we can do is wait until next year and try again. Who knows maybe Fern will have mellowed a bit more by then, we can only hope.
