Sadly we had to say goodbye to Kiwi today. She suffered some sort of prolapse of her vagina. It was very distressing for Derek and I, but fortunately Kiwi didn't show any outward signs of distress. Our vet checked her over and sadly there was nothing that could be done for her, so we had to make the horribly difficult decision to let her go.

She had been having intermittent bleeding for a couple of weeks and our vet had given us a course of antibiotics, on the off chance it was an infection. We were aware that the bleeding could have been caused by a tumour and had started to prepare ourselves for the worst, even so we still weren't quite ready to loose her so soon.

Kiwi was with us for far too short a time, it seems so unfair. It feels like we never really got to know her or give her the life she deserved. I know it is better for her to have had a home where she was wanted and loved, but she deserved better and I wish we had got the chance to show her how much we loved her. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Kiki and her family" class="size-full wp-image-9024" title="Our rats enjoying a glass of milk" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/post_3282.jpg" alt="Kiki and her family" height="529" %}
