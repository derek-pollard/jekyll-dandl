Everything seemed to have gone well after Pippin's last operation. We were relieved when the vet told us his previous lump had been an abscess and once his wound had healed up we thought that was the end of it. Unfortunately another lump has come up, pretty much in the same place as the last one.

We talked our options through with the vet and have decided to put Pippin through another surgery. We could have had the abscess lanced, but the vet explained that their is a risk with small animals that the infection from the abscess will leak into the surrounding tissue once it has been punctured. If they operate they should be able to get all the infected tissue out without bursting the sack the puss is in. It all sounds really disgusting.

It is hard to know what to do for the best as they operated the first time and the abscess, if that's what this second lump is, has returned. So, Pippin is booked in for the end of the week and we're going to spoil him rotten until then and then spoil him even more once he's had his operation.

Pepper has just finished his course of antibiotics after his horrible chest infection. We still have no clue what caused Pepper's illness and can only hope it never returns and now Pippin is poorly again. We love our two rattie boys so very much and it is going to be a difficult couple of weeks, hoping they are both going to be all right.
