Derek and I have been fascinated by degus for a number of years. Having seen them on other pet sites that I love to follow, they seemed like amazing little critters. We have often considered having some, but they are not easy to get hold of where we live - until now! Our newest member of the family is a little scruffy, all on his own and may not seem like the best introduction for first time degu owner, but he is impossibly cute and adventurous and it was love at first site for both Derek and I.

After a sorry start to life, having been separated from his litter due to mites and put into isolation (he was the only one affected) so he could be treated, he found himself alone, with a few bald spots and in desperate need of a family. As he could no longer be sold through a pet shop he found himself up for adoption through a local pet charity, which is where we found him.

Derek chose the name Max for our newest addition, and it seems to suit him very well! After barely 24 hours Max has already left the cage of his own accord, explored our bedroom and been very amiable to being put back in his home - once we'd caught him that was. He's a fast, but confident little guy, which is great, the last thing we want is to scare him while trying to round him up.

I have to admit to being surprised at how quickly he has settled in with us, maybe it is the way of the degu or maybe our little Max is going to grow into a right handful! Either way we are loving the new experience, and as Max grows and of course has met our cat Inkie, he will be able to explore more of the house.
