Oh my goodness how time flies when you have a family of six super cute rats to keep you entertained. There has been so much change with all six of the girls and they are all so much more than we could have hoped for. Everyone has settled in well, especially the mums, Bella and PomPom. They have been through a lot, overcoming the stress of their previous life in their own little ways.

## Bella

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9572" title="Our beautiful brown hooded rat, Bella" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_8288.jpg" alt="Our beautiful brown hooded rat, Bella" width="390" height="212" /> When we first adopted Bella she was very tense. Understandably so, having been taken from a home while pregnant, where she wasn't cared for properly. Then having her babies at the RSPCA, before finally moving in with us. There was a lot of change and stress in her life, I don't even want to think about it.

Bella would let us hold her, but you could feel a rigidity in her body, as though she was only tolerating us. Over time that changed and her body relaxed, even enjoyed a bit of a cuddle. Bella started climbing on us and wanted to be handled. Most amazing was her face, her features changed dramatically when she really started believing in her new life with us. We always thought Bella was a pretty girl, but her face became soft and happy. I'm pretty sure Bella's relaxed attitude had a positive effect on the babies as well.

There was a little hiccup along the way though. As the babies started to get more confident they demanded more of our attention. The made Bella a bit upset, so we made sure to always give her lots of cuddles at playtime, even if we are being swarmed by the babies.

## PomPom

{% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="PomPom and Lindsay" class="size-full wp-image-9580" title="Our rat PomPom sitting on my head!" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_8191.jpg" alt="PomPom and Lindsay" height="453" %}We were warned from the outset that PomPom was a character, and they were right, but for all the wrong reasons. At the homing centre PomPom was a bit standoffish and always wanted to escape her cage. That hasn't changed, she loves to head off on her little adventures, but my goodness she is a big, cuddly, softie now. PomPom love cuddles and if she doesn't get them she can be a bit naughty. Nothing terrible, but I can't bare the thought of her thinking we don't love her.

PomPom has lots of fun on her escaping adventures. Come playtime she is the first out of the cage and out across the room before we know she's gone. One lap of our home office and she'll be back for cuddles or treats. While the babies are small we keep the girls shut in the office because we do have two cats and as soft as they are we don't want to take any risks. At nighttime feeding PomPom is off like a shot. None of the other girls are interested in coming out at bedtime so PomPom is free to wander wherever she wants.

While PomPom has the run of the upstairs, she finds the stairs bit scary. Not that it's a problem, there's plenty for her to explore and climb upstairs. It also makes it much easier for us to keep an eye on her. Our little cat Jessie is pretty much a house cat, and she adores PomPom. She will go flying around while PomPom is running about. It doesn't scare PomPom, on the contrary she seems to want to follow Jessie, there is no aggression between the two which is lovely. I think it's a good friendship for both of them.

## Peppy

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_8581.jpg" alt="Our rat Peppy out exploring" title="Our rat Peppy out exploring" width="390" height="293" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9589" /> From the beginning Peppy was the most outgoing of the babies and that's still the same. One thing that has changed with little Peppy is her fur. I was so thrilled with our new arrivals and I didn't pay much attention to Peppy's silver stripe or her dark eyes - well that was until she started to fade! Our beautiful little rat is a husky! Peppy's fur is now a kind of dirty grey and I'm guessing she's going to be fully white by the time she's finished fading. What a lovely surprise, I do love husky rats.

As well as being the most adventurous of the four babies, Peppy is also the most affectionate. That wonderful feeling of a baby rat jumping on you from nowhere, like she's been thrown at you! Of course it's just super, happy, baby rat exuberance, but she does land with a plop and want cuddles. Once you've got her she goes all wiggly, but put her down and she'll have a happy bounce before landing on you again. Hours of fun!

## Bijou

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_8395.jpg" alt="Our young rat, Bijou" title="Our young rat, Bijou" width="390" height="233" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9591" /> At the homing centre the staff felt Bella and Bijou were very close. It wasn't just that they look alike, but they were often found together. Someone else was was planing to adopt two of the six babies, but when I decided to take the remaining babies and mums, the RSPCA staff chose to keep Bijou and Bella together. And they were right, Bijou does seem very close to her mum. Bijou is a very happy and active little girl, but there are times, such as when they go in after playtime you will always find Bijou near her mum.

Bijou is a lovely little girl and she has the softest fur. Of course she is still a baby, so their fur is always very soft, but my goodness even compared to the other babies her coat is amazing. Getting a cuddle with this Bijou is a super soft treat.

After Peppy she is the second most crazy active baby. Although she is very close to Bella, she's very happy to find her own way at playtime and she loves to play with her sisters.

## Peanut

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_8644.jpg" alt="Our little rat, Peanut, peaking out from under a unit" title="Our little rat, Peanut, peaking out from under a unit" width="390" height="222" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9599" /> Goodness our Peanut is growing into a right bruiser, mostly in size if not in temperament. She is a big solid baby. When you hold her, she's quite a weight and not in a 'squishy I've eaten too many treats' way. She's grey like PomPom, though a shade or two darker, we don't know if they are mum and daughter.

Despite her size Peanut is a sweet little girl, being very gentle with her sisters and two mums. She's finding her confidence a bit slower than Peppy and Bijou and there are times when we have to stop her sleeping though playtimes. She doesn't mind being woken up and most of the time she'll come out and have fun. Being only young were happy not to push her too hard, but we don't want that solid muscle turning into a chubby tummy if she doesn't run around enough.

## Pashmina

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/post_83431.jpg" alt="Our grey hooded rat, Pashmina" title="Our grey hooded rat, Pashmina" width="390" height="265" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9602" /> Last we have Pashmina -- what a funny little girl. Derek and I aren't quite sure what to make of her. Don't get me wrong, she is adorable and we love her very much, she's just a little difficult to connect with. Normally you can win rats over with kindness, treats and happy, regular playtimes, but not Pashmina. We cannot find a single treat she wants to eat! There is nothing wrong with her appetite, she looks healthy and is growing normally, she's just in her own little world.

It makes us happy she's with her family, even though at times she looks at them as though they are bonkers. They all get along brilliantly, especially her and Peppy, we will often find her following Peppy around. Not even Peppy bouncing out the cage can convince Pashmina to leave. Luckily it's a nice big cage, so she'll get exercise wandering around and climbing.
