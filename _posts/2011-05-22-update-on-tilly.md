I'm very pleased to say Tilly is coping very well on her own. It was a difficult time for all of us first losing Smudge to old age and then Tula being so poorly, though I think out of everything Tilly found Tula's illness the hardest to cope with. Tula was so very poorly that she didn't respond to Tilly, it was very difficult for us to see her being ignored by her sister, and we understood how poorly Tula was, but for sweet little Tilly who adored her sister it must have been terrible.

Tilly got quite down while Tula was sick, we tried to be there for her, but we were trying to care for Tula, and Tilly would go off and hide when we tried to play with her. She didn't respond to treats either and the whole situation was quite difficult.

After Tula died, I'm pleased to say Tilly's mood improved and she turned to us for comfort. We were able to give her treats and really started to spoil her, giving her a bit of every meal we had. Tilly had developed a bit of a respiratory infection, but she was happy and enjoying all the extra attention.

Just over a month after Tula died, we found a lump under Tilly's armpit. It was scary, especially after what had happened to Tula. Because of all the stress Tilly had been under and her respiratory infection we decided not to have her lump removed. We couldn't bare to lose her and putting her through the stress of an anaesthetic, and surgery just seemed cruel.

So, we left it, then just over a month after finding the first lump we found a second. This one was lower down her body and on the opposite side. Derek and I are both upset, although I'm pleased to say Tilly is oblivious, happily being pandered to by us and enjoying all the naughty treats we give her.

I don't know what the future will hold for Tilly, but we won't have her operated on. The first lump is getting to big too be removed now - the bigger the lump the bigger the operation and wound - and we don't know if anymore lumps are going to appear.

We made the decision to enjoy our time with Tilly and continue to spoil her as long as we all have together. Tilly is a wonderful and brave little rat, and we feel so blessed to have her in our lives. I'm pretty sure she knows how much we love her, and despite everything that she has been through she is a wonderful and happy little rat who enjoys sharing our dinners!
