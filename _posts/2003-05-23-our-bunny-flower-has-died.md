His seizures had been under control for many weeks but Friday morning he had a very severe one and then continued with several more seizures as the day progressed, until he passed away peacefully at home. Sadly both Derek and I were away from home while Flower was ill, we had been in Cornwall for the week and my mum had been taking care of our family for us. She had called us early in the morning as we were preparing to head home, at first we just thought it was a normal seizure Flower was having. Mum told us that although Flower was back on his feet he was still quite wobbly. It was very difficult being so far away and we phoned home several times during our six hour journey home. Flower had several more seizures throughout the day and we were very relieved to finally be home. Mum greeted us at the front door saying that she had just checked on Flower and he seemed okay. I went straight upstairs to see him, but he had passed away. It was a terrible shock for all of us, but at least we knew he had not suffered. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Flower and Thumper" class="size-full wp-image-6675" title="Our dwarf bunnies, Flower and Thumper underneath our bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2003/05/post_4696_IMG.jpg" alt="Flower and Thumper" height="409" %} 

Thumper was lost at first without his brother, he did not want to leave his run and just slept a lot. A few weeks on and he has brightened up again. We love Thumper very much but it is hard not to feel sad to know Flower is gone, he had only been in our lives five short years and we had hoped the cheeky pair of bunnies would be getting into mischief together for few more to come. We both spend a lot of time talking to Thumper, letting him know we love him and just how special he is to us.
