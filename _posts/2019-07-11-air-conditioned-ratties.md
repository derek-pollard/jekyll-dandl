We love our little girls very much, but we have beens struggling to get to know them as well as we'd like. At first I thought they were just a bit on the timid side. They loved to come out of their cage, but they spent most of their out of cage time running around underneath my desk rather than exploring the office. We've been giving them time and gradually they started climbing a bit more, but were still a bit timid and very easy to startle.

A few weeks ago we had air-conditioning installed in our home office and while its not been partially hot here in the UK, the difference in the girls is amazing. As I write this they have been out and about for over an hour and are currently running rampage all over Derek's desk (they have never been up there before). It is amazing to see, the change in them is so sudden.

Ruby is the smallest and so far the shyest of the girls, and even she has been climbing on me enjoying a cuddle. We were looking forward to having the AC, but now it has had such an incredible impact on our rats, it seems like an a amazing gift.
