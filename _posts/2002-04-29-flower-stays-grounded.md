{% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="'Let us out'" class="size-full wp-image-6660" title="Our dwarf bunnies, Thumper and Flower waiting at their run door keen to come out and play" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/04/post_4686_IMG.jpg" alt="'Let us out'" height="299" %} 

As much as Thumper loves to climb and explore, our little guy Flower likes to keep his feet firmly on the ground. The boys have lots of boxes, tunnels and shelves in their bunny run, and while Thumper will always come flying over the top of any obstacle, Flower likes to make his way under or through. After some box rearranging by Thumper our sweet little Flower got trapped in the run.

Thumper has always loved shoving things around and this time had managed to create a barricade of boxes and toys between Flower and the exit. I'd let the bunnies out and not noticed what had happened or that Flower was trapped in the run!

When neither bunny came barreling out to play, I went to see what was wrong and found little Flower stuck in the run, and Thumper not looking very impressed at all, because Thumper won't come out and play without Flower. Once I realised what had happened I cleared the way for Flower, and both bunnies scampered off to play.

While they were gone it was time for some serious rearranging of their run to stop it happening again. We have made sure there is always a tunnel against the wall, so no matter what Thumper moves, Flower will always have an exit. We've also made sure there is lots of room for Flower to get under the boxes, even if naughty Thumper shoves things in the way.

Our sweet little boys are so close and loving with each other, yet so completely different in personalities and habits. We are having so much fun sharing our home with them. Goodness knows what they'll get up to next.
