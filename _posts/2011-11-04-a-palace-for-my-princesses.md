Like many rat lovers, I've always loved the Ferplast range of ferret cages. I bought a Furet Plus several years ago for my little girl, [Petal](http://www.derekandlindsay.co.uk/pets/rats/petal/), it has housed many rats since and I'm pleased to say that it is still going strong today. I really wanted to treat my new trio of girls to a nice new shiny home, and what better cage for three gorgeous little girls, who I intend to spoil rotten than a Furet XL.

Derek wasn't sure at first, mainly because we have two cats, and it's important that we can keep our cages up off the floor, away from their reach. Fortunately I tracked down a table that wasn't too expensive, well not when you compared it to the price of the cage. So once we'd got the table, I ordered the cage from Zooplus, who dispatched it really quickly and we took delivery of a huge box a few days later.

Putting the cage together, as it comes flat pack, was really simple, but goodness me, filling it with all the hammocks and toys I'd got for the girls was hard work. We were quite tired by the end, but the girls were bouncing with energy and ready to check out their new home. Although they'd only been with us a week, the girls took really well to the move and seem to be enjoying all the extra space.

I'm delighted with the cage, though I'm not so sure about all the work at cleaning out time, I can only hope it will get easier with more practice. Seeing the girls climbing and playing about in the cage makes all the effort worth while. It's the biggest cage I've ever had, and I'm really looking forward to watching the girls grow up in it.
