<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-9652" title="Our fluffy white cat Inkie curled up asleep" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/post_6178.jpg" alt="Our fluffy white cat Inkie curled up asleep" width="390" height="293" />We've always known Inkie can be a little madam. She's always loved to pinch beds and seats that were occupied and claim them as her own for a few weeks until she gets bored and then moves on. She did it to Cubbie, seeing him sleeping somewhere and then pinching it once he'd vacated so he couldn't come back. She does it to us, wanting seats we've been sat in then using them as her own until she goes off them. And of course now she does it to Jessie.

Except now she has taken it a step further. We have blankets on our furniture, because Inkie is so fluffy she will cover seats, and us, in white fluff after one nap. So we put nice fleecy blankets down for her to sleep on, simply lifting them off to use the seats. It was always a good plan, Inkie got somewhere cozy to snooze on and we get cat fur free furniture. Then Jessie came along.

Jessie has a strange way of doing most things, and that includes sleeping. Despite her lovely fur coat and a centrally heated home, she loves nothing more than to snuggle under a blanket. We've had Inkie for ten years now and she has never snuggled underneath a blanket, until now... {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Oh Inkie!" class="size-full wp-image-9654" title="Our silly can't sleeping under blankets" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/post_copycat.jpg" alt="Our silly can't sleeping under blankets" height="476" %}
