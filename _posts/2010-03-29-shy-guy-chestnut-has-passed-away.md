It was a very sad end to what had been an exciting weekend of new rattie arrivals. His passing was very peaceful, and though we donâ€™t know exactly how old he was, I'm pretty sure he had reached a good old age.

I don't think Chestnut ever really got over being abandoned by his first family, still he was a lovely rat and we loved him very much. He was never very keen on leaving his cage to come out and play, and he would have these little panic attacks where he couldn't quite catch his breath. We found it best to let him be and fuss him in his cage, and we did spoil him with baby food and human food, which he loved.

While we are very sorry to see Chestnut go, it is good to know he passed away peacefully, with a full tummy after sharing our dinner with us.
