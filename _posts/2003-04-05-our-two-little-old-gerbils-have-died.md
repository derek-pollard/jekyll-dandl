Sadly both of our two remaining gerbils have passed away. Old age caught up with them and they both slowed down, we first noticed the amount of cardboard they were getting through had decreased. Then the time they wanted to spend out of their cage grew shorter. Our precious little Millie died on March 18 and little Syrup passed away a few weeks later on April 4. At just over three and a half years in age, they were both a very special pair of gerbils. We are really going to miss them.

After all the fun we had with our four little girls we made the difficult decision not to have any more gerbils for a while. Barley, Rogue, Syrup and Millie are going to be a hard act to follow, we really do miss them. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Our four beautiful girls" class="size-full wp-image-6516" title="Our four gerbils sitting in Derek's hands" src="/wp-content/uploads/2003/04/post_3620.jpg" alt="Our four beautiful girls" height="481" %}
