More lumps I'm afraid, this time out sweet shy girl, Ruby. Oh goodness it's been a lot to process. Topaz has made a wonderful recovery from her operation, all that's left is for her fur to grow back. She's still quite patchy where her side was shaved, but her wound is all healed and she's back to her old naughty self. With Topaz's recovery we thought we were through the worst, and had hoped this would be the end of rattie lumps, but sadly no. We noticed a lump on Ruby, on her tummy next to her back left leg, just like Topaz's first and Sapphire's and knew we had to get it removed.

Ruby had her surgery on the 26th of February, a week ago now and I'm pleased to say she came through it incredibly well. The vets were a little concerned that Ruby wasn't eating after her surgery, but once she was home with her sisters she was happier than we could ever wish for after such an ordeal. Her wound healed up very quickly and Ruby has carried on with life like nothing happened. I must admit I was very scared, because she is such a sensitive and shy girl. She's one of those rats who loves you but needs her sisters with her to be confident and happy. Still she coped amazingly with being away from home and we are both so proud of her.

Fingers crossed our beautiful Gems are though all the lumps and worries and we can all enjoy all our extra time together while in lockdown!
