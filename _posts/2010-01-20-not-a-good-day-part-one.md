When we got up last Friday we already knew it was going to be a bad day as we had made the horrible decision to have our sweet [little girl, Daisy](/daisy-peach-apricot/) put to sleep. Her appointment was at 2.30 that afternoon, so we weren’t in the best of moods, but when we went into our dining room, where our boys live, to feed Conker his breakfast of baby food, things got worse.

Conker's condition had deteriorated severely since we had last seen him at bedtime. He had pretty much lost all control of his legs, he couldn't stand up and kept rolling over and he wasn't interested in his baby food. We called our vets straightaway who gave us an immediate appointment.

Our vet confirmed what we suspected, that there wasn't much that could be done for Conker and agreed to have him put to sleep. It was very difficult, we had been getting very close to Conker with feeding him baby food three times a day, but there was no way we could leave him in the condition he was. The vet did offer us some treatment, but as is often the case with rats it is guess work, it may work and it wasn't anything we hadn't already tried.

Conker wasn't with us for very long, but he was a lovely boy and we are really going to miss him very much.
