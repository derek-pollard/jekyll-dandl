Today is our 27th wedding anniversary and what else do people do on their anniversary? Get gerbils of course!

I've been feeling very sad over the passing of Plum, the last of my family of six gerbils. Combined with the deaths of two of my rats and a big space on Derek's desk, where our girls used to live, I was thinking about rehoming a little gerbil, who'd not had the best start in life. Looking around adoption websites I found a little girl, Lime who was just round the corner from us. So, we jumped on our bicycles and peddled round to meet her. Luckily for Lime she’d already found a home, but it left me thinking about how much I love having gerbils. So, I went snooping at the pet store and found two gorgeous boys. Before we’d even got back home I’d named them Sunny and Moomin. Derek wasn’t too sure about having baby gerbils, but it is was our wedding anniversary and what better gift than little critters! Once home we had a little think about the gerbils, and a cup of tea before heading back out in our car and two super sweet gerbils joined our family. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Sunny & Moomin" class="size-full wp-image-8594" title="Our new gerbils, Sunny and moomin" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/post_sunnymoomin01.jpg" alt="Sunny & Moomin" height="379" %} 

Moomin is about twice the size of little Sunny, so only time will tell how much they grow. For now though they are both very busy exploring their new home and discovering the gerbily joys of cardboard tubes.
