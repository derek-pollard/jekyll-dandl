It has been three months since we lost little Barley and our two remaining gerbils are keeping us very busy. At first it was quiet a shock for Millie and Syrup, Barley had been the leader of our little gang and it was quite an adjustment just being the two of them. Millie and Syrup have coped very well with all the changes, they spend far more time together than they had before, we very rarely see one of them alone.

Both gerbils demand a lot of attention from us, far more than they even did as babies. We had originally responded to them by letting them out every night, but of course they are old gerbils and this just over tired them. They would very quickly get tired and start being naughty and fighting. We have now settled into a happy rhythm with them, letting them out every other night for about half an hour. Of course everyday we give them lots of attention while they are in their cage, but nothing can make up for the fun they have while climbing all over us. They are both still very healthy and active and have celebrated their third birthday in August we are very proud of them.
