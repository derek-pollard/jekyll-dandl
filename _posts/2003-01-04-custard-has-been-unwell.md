We had noticed he wasn't very happy going to the toilet and had been keeping an eye on him. Then the week before Christmas he became very unhappy, whining and grumbling not knowing what to do with himself. We took him straight to the vet and they admitted him, it was very difficult leaving Custard behind not knowing what was wrong with him. Later that day the vet phoned to say Custard had bladder stones and they had given him a catheter and would keep him in for a few days to see how he was going.

It was a long three days without Custard following us around the house and we were very relieved to finally bring him home. After a few days we realised that even with his special medicine Custard was still having problems. We took him straight back to the vets, who told us the best thing for him was an operation, which would end his problems once and for all.

Christmas Eve Custard had his operation, we were very relieved to get the phone call telling us he was okay. Because it was such a serious procedure Custard had to stay at the vets for the rest of the week. Custard is a big baby and the the nurses at the veterinary surgery were very taken with him. Custard was very happy when we brought him home, though he wasn't very impressed with not being allowed out of the cat flap. We were pleased to have him back safe and sound, Christmas just hadn't been the same knowing he was on his own. After a few days Custard was back to his old self having made a full recovery, showing what a special little cat he is and when he was finally allowed out of the house he only went as far as the bottom of the garden, funny Custard. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Treacle and Custard home safe and well" class="size-full wp-image-6557" title="My two cats snoozing on our bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2003/01/post1473_IMG.jpg" alt="Treacle and Custard home safe and well" height="403" %}
