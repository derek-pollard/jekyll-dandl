We decided there was room in our home for some more little ratties. Instead of going down the pet shop we wanted to rehome some rats. Derek telephoned our local Wood Green Animal Shelter, they had twelve rats looking for a home, so off we went. Derek was hoping for some little girls, but I didn't care. The twelve rats were all in an enormous cage together, the boys were all neutered so everyone could live happily together. Before we could choose our rats we had to prove we had a nice big cage for everyone to live in, as our cage is to big to fit in our car we used the pictures on this web site to show how much we love and spoil little rats. After seeing our web page the animal shelter assistant obviously knew we were push overs and pulled out two large brown boys, who had been with the shelter for awhile and needed a home. I took one look at the boys and fell in love, they were so friendly and gentle. Derek still wanted some girls and already had his eye on a baby cinnamon hooded rat who had gently placed his finger in her mouth to see what he tasted like. While the assistant was looking for her sister the cheeky little rat disappeared up Derek's sleeve. So that was our four.

Naming the rats has been fun, at the homing centre the girls were called Rachel and Rosie and the boys Carl and Hammer. As each pair of rats looks pretty much the same we had no idea which was which. So we decided to rename them to make them part of the family. As Lindsay wanted the boys it was up to her to name them, so they are now called Cookie and Bourbon. Derek took a little longer to think of his names, with the help of Fancy Rats website he came up with Coral and Clover. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Our new arrivals taking in they new surroundings" class="size-full wp-image-7157" title="Four rat peering out of their cage door" src="/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/page_3181.jpg" alt="Our new arrivals taking in they new surroundings" height="541" %} 

Unfortunately the new little ratties have found the whole experience very stressful. We are being very gentle with them, not taking them away from their cage and of course giving them yoghurt drops. It must be a shock to have come from the homing centre sharing with twelve rats, but we hope given time they will adapt and enjoy their new home and all the attention we have to offer.
