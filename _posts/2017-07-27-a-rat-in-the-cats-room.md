Bluebell is by far the most adventurous rat our of our girls and she often spends her play time in the cats room. Often we will find her fast asleep in one of the many cat beds in that room, and it can be a challenge to figure out which one she's in! Her other favourite 'cat' thing is their toys. She loves to hide them in hard to reach places. Once she ever brought one all the way back to the rat cage, where her sisters destroyed it!

With the arrival of our new kitten, the cats room is currently off limits to Bluebell, but don't worry she has lots of other rooms to get into rattie mischief in.
