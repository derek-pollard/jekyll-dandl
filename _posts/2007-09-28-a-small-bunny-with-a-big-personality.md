I have no idea if it's because she is a female bunny, we've never had a girl bunny before, or whether she is just bonkers, but we don't know what to do with our little rabbit. So far she has been jumping on our bed, trying to dig in the duvet, jumping on the furniture, digging in plant pots and eating the houseplants.

Her latest bit of naughtiness is in the evening. We always let her out at bedtime, while we lie in bed and read, but she has started jumping on the bed and tugging Derek's magazine off him, demanding his attention. Not very relaxing, but it is cute :-). Don't get me wrong we love her to bits and think she's great, but goodness me she's still only a baby I dread to think what she is going to get into next.

I have read that this is an adolescent phase that some bunnies go through, that should last about a year. If we survive it, Fern will end up this wonderful little bunny and it will have all been worth it. I am hoping this phase Fern is going through is like a test and the more we put up with from her the more affectionate, sweeter and well behaved she will be by the end.

One thing is for sure, we haven’t even had Fern a month, and we don’t know how we are going to survive the next year! But we do love her. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Spot the rabbit" class="size-full wp-image-6268" title="A naughty bunny hiding behind a plant pot" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/post_9590.jpg" alt="Spot the rabbit" height="398" %}
