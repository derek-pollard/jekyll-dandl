In the space of three days both our lovely boy Kapy and his sweet little brother Mango have passed away. Kapy had been a bit under the weather for awhile, but with lots of love, attention and baby food his condition had started to improve. He was back to spending more time with his brothers and getting about his cage more. We honestly thought he was on the mend, but sadly on Saturday we found he'd passed away. Bless him he looked so peaceful laying on his side in bed, like he'd slipped away dreaming happy dreams.

Unfortunately during Kapy's illness little Mango had taken another turn for the worse. I don't know if it was due to all the time Kapy was spending away from the cage as we cared for him, or just a horrible coincidence, but Mango Mango's condition deteriorated very quickly until we had no choice but to take him to the vets and let him go. Mango has struggled on and off with respiratory problems since we first had him. Usually a strong course of Baytril would sort him out and he'd be okay for a few months then it would hit again. He was usually quite bright and happy, though not impressed with his medicine, but it never affected his enjoyment of life, and had become one of those things. This time though we could see he was in terrible difficulties and we knew we had to take care of him. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Chips, Kapy and Mango our beautiful boys" class="size-full wp-image-6437" title="Our rats Chips, Kapy and mango in their favourite place - bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/post_3583.jpg" alt="Chips, Kapy and Mango our beautiful boys" height="341" %} 

It's been a difficult few days, more so for our gorgeous boy, Chips who has lost his two bothers and looks terribly lost in that big cage on his own. Right from the start the four boys were incredibly loving with each other and despite their size, different personalities and little Mango's health problems they loved each other deeply and always slept together in a rather smelly rattie pile up.

We shall keep a close eye on Chips and see what we can do to get him through this difficult time.
