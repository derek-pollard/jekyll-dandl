I had no idea cats teethed, or rather I'd never really thought about it. I never noticed Inkie losing any of her baby teeth, and all our other cats were over six months old when we adopted them. But Jessie is definitely teething. She will go through bouts of chewing on something, usually me, and then hey-presto there is a little tooth, which I have found myself keeping.

We are having lots of fun getting to know Jessie and all her silly ways. Like how she loves to carry her favourite pom-pom toy around with her. Once while she was teething she actually chewed right through the elastic, and we had to tie it back together for her. She loves that toy so much we actually have a spare one, and sometimes I wonder if we should get a couple more!

Life with Jessie is full of new experiences. She doesn't seem to have that independent streak you would expect to see in a cat. If we go out she will usually return to her room and wait for us, sometimes even preferring to be shut away for a nap if we are going to be gone for a long time.
