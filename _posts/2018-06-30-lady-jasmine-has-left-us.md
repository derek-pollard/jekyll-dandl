I'm very sad to say we had to make the difficult decision to say goodbye to our beautiful Lady JasmineÂ this morning. We first noticed a lump on her throat last year. Even though it was very small we decided not to have it removed. Jasmine was such a timid little rat we were afraid the stress of surgery would be too much for her. She could also be a little uncooperative about getting out of bed to play at the best of times, so caring for her after surgery would have been a challenge.

Thankfully the lump proved to be very slow growing and we had many happy months spoiling our sweet girl until she started to deteriorate. The size of the lump beginning to be a problem for Jasmine and in the last few days her breathing had become laboured. We don't know if it was caused by the lump or a separate issue, but we felt it was the right time to let our beautiful girl go.

Our vet was very supportive of our decision and took great care of Jasmine, who was not happy to be away from her home and sisters. I will always have such a soft spot for husky rats, which Jasmine was. She faded to almost white in her two years with us, but her beautiful eyes always shone brightly with happiness. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Jasmine as a baby and all grown up" class="size-full wp-image-8515" title="Our husky rat Jasmine, before she faded and after" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/post_jasmine.jpg" alt="Jasmine as a baby and all grown up" height="487" %}
