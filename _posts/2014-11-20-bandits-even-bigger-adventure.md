There is no stopping Bandit at the moment. He has always been fascinated by the stairs and looking down them, but has never quite plucked up the courage to go down even one step. The other day I popped him down a few steps, to see what would happen, but he was not happy with me and ran back into the office.

Today he'd been sitting on my knee and had snuck off while I as in the middle of something on my computer. I didn't think he'd get very far - I was wrong. By the time I went looking for my sneaky little rat he was all the way downstairs! Fortunately both the cats were outside,<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6384" title="Little Bandit at the bottom of the stairs" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/post_1551.jpg" alt="Little Bandit at the bottom of the stairs" width="310" height="233" /> because he was happily playing on their cat post. When I caught up with the wayward chap he wasn't at all sorry for sneaking off, instead he wandered off into our living room and had a good explore in there.

It's great to see Bandit doing so well on his own and though we both still miss Wombat terribly, I'm enjoying all Bandit's new adventures.
