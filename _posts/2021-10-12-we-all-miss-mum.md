Lindsay passed away suddenly and everyone is heartbroken.

### PomPom's entry:

Mum has stopped coming to play with us and feed us. Dad cleaned out our home and he's never done that before. He comes to let us out and we've been outside a couple of times but we couldn't find mum and we don't want to play outside if she's not there. Bijou and Pashmina are scared, Peanut tries to pretend she isn't, but I can tell.

I still like to go for a wonder at bedtime and the first few times I hoped that if I looked hard enough I would find mum but I didn't.

Dad takes care of us, he comes to see us and play with us but it's not the same without mum. She was so special to us all.
