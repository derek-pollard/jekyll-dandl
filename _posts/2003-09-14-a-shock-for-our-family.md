It was a terrible blow for us, even though he had been poorly for a week, we just weren't prepared to loose him. The previous weekend Willow had fallen in his cage and hurt his leg, not being able to get around made him quite depressed. While he was feeling unwell a respiratory infection took hold and our beautiful bouncy Willow just couldn't shake it off. We took him to the vets and got him special rattie medicine, we also fed him lots of baby food to keep his strength up.

Sadly nothing we could do was enough. Willow was a very special bouncy little rat and his time with us far too short, we are both heart broken at his passing. While we love Biscuit and Badger dearly and Willow wasn't even a planned addition to our family, things just won't be the same without him. Biscuit and Badger are still just as spoilt as they have always been, but even so we can see that they miss Willow. He really was a special little rat who made a big impact on anyone who ever knew him with his happy outlook. Our family was very lucky to have known him, if only for such a short time.
