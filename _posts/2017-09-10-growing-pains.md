When we got Jessie, we had hoped that she stay close to home, like Inkie and Cubbie had before her. With her being black we had already decided she wasn't going to be allowed out after dark. But of course if she wanted to wander, like Treacle and Custard had done, there was nothing we could, or would, do to stop her. Well, with Jessie it seems our wish seems to have gone a little askew, as we cannot convince our little cat to go out at all.

Once Jessie had her final check-up from her spay, and her feline leukaemia booster, we have done nothing to stop her leaving the house. She knows where the cat-flap is, and has seen Inkie using it. There have been times the back door has been left open, but Jessie has shown no interest. Last weekend Derek actually carried her out into the garden, which is completely fenced in and private, but Jessie was not impressed, so we had to bring her back in. Yesterday I held her by the back door, which was open, I had no intention of taking her out, we were just waiting for Derek to come in, Jessie looked up at me and cried her unhappy cry.

Who knows what the future holds for our little cat, but for now we are thinking Jessie is going to be a house cat. Although we weren't really prepared for an indoor cat, I thought all young cats wanted to spend time outside, even super shy Cubbie liked to go outside! Still we are working things out with having the rodents and a cat in the house all the time. The degus aren't much of a problem, as we shut them in the dining room when they play, though Jessie does like to get underfoot when we are wheeling their cages around. When the rats come out, because Bluebell likes to roam all over the house, we shut Jessie in her room. She doesn't seem to mind. She actually likes to be shut in for a nap at midday anyway, if we don't she turns into a right devil biting us and being really naughty.

It is a very strange routine we have with out little cat, having to put her to bed several times a day, and not wanting to go outside, but she seems to be thriving on it. And if that's what Jessie wants who are we to tell her different.
