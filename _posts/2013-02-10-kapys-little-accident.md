Poor Kapy has hurt his foot, it's very swollen and he doesn't like standing on it. I'm pretty sure nothing is broken as he is managing to hobble round and he is still able to climb up to his favourite bed at the top of the cage.

We can only guess he twisted it climbing up the bars to bed, or maybe he fell off one of their wooden ledges. They are meant to help them get around the cage, but Kapy has gotten a bit large of bottom and struggles to fit on them, so he could have fallen off one of those. Either way I'm going to have to sort something out.

It's hard to say whether the brothers are clumsy or a bit lazy, because I've noticed they don't always take care when getting up to their higher beds, choosing to scramble up the last bit rather than get high enough to step onto the shelves. Mango and Chips do fine, but they are smaller boys so I guess it's easier for them. The boys already have two large corner shelves and some wooden ledges in their home so I'm not sure what else I can do. My thinking at the moment is a new cage - just don't tell Derek!
