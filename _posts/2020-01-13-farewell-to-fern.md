We had a wonderful and quiet Christmas with our family and got to spend lots of time with Fern. It was over this time we started to notice a real change in her, Fern was getting very tired while out in the garden. We moved her indoor night-time cage out of the dining room, which she shared with our two degus, to upstairs where we could bring her in earlier at night, without impacting our degus night-time routine. Fern was happy to spend all this extra time indoors, which was not like her at all, she has always been an outdoor bunny. Even with this change Fern's her energy levels continued to drop and we could see she was having difficulty getting around the garden.

Our little rabbit has always been very independent, and rather bossy, which made it very difficult to see her struggle and have to rely on us. As much as we loved having Fern in our lives we never wanted to see her lose her independence, and having reached the grand bunny age of twelve we knew there was nothing we could do to improve her quality of life.

It was a very painful day, making the decision to say goodbye to Fern, but we did know it was the right time to let her go. Our vet was very kind and sympathetic to our decision and we stayed with her until she slipped away.

Of course we brought our bunny home with us, so we could burry her in the garden she loved, and ruled, so very much. Our home feels incredibly empty without Fern in our lives. We spent every day of the last twelve years keeping a very close eye on what our bunny was doing in the garden and which plants she was chomping. There have been many bunny tunnels that needed filling in and kept away from the fences. Things are definitely going to be very quiet without her. Even as she got older, Fern was still very much full of adventure and discovery. She loved our cats and made sure to keep a very close eye on us whenever we were in her garden. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Fern and Inkie" class="size-full wp-image-9284" title="Our little bunny, Fern and Inkie the cat sleeping in the garden" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/post_6863.jpg" alt="Our little bunny, Fern and Inkie the cat sleeping in the garden" height="384" %} 

Even through all our sadness we know how blessed we were to have shared twelve wonderful years with our bunny, especially one as amazing as Fern. Words and photos will never express just how much we loved her, or what a huge hole her passing has left in our hearts, but we will never forget her and will always be thankful that she shared our lives as long as she did.
