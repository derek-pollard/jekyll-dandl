After a short illness, he slipped away in my arms yesterday afternoon.

Our fun loving little guy was so very young and full of life. Together with his cheeky brother, Bandit, he brought so much silliness and laughter to our office, even when we were trying to work. As brothers the boys were inseparable, whether snuggled up in their bed together, finding mischief to get into, or generally being underfoot.

I don't know how we or Bandit will cope with this terrible loss, but we will try to encourage Bandit to carry on his silly adventures in his beautiful brothers memory.
