[Our sweet rattie girl, Sundew](/sundew-sage-ivy/), is getting quite old now, and while we love her dearly Derek and I felt would be a good time for some baby rats to join our family. As we'd had so many girl rats these past few years, it seemed like a good time to get a pair of cuddly boys again. As with all these things nothing goes according to plan, and while looking for two boy rats, we went and fell in love with some sweet little girls - four of them! After years of having rats, I don't like splitting up family groups. You never know who is the dominant rat, who is more bonded with who, or maybe I just have love to be overrun with little rats. Whatever the reason I couldn't chose between these four beautiful sisters, so Derek had no choice but to get them all :-).

Three of the girls are blue (I'm not to into rat colouring, but I think thats what their called) and one is black. As they are all so precious it only seemed fair that they should be named after gems. Sapphire is the black one, Topaz is the palest of the three blue girls, Ruby is slightly darker and little Opal has a white tummy and pink tip on her tail. It sounds very wimple here, but I'm pretty sure Derek and I will be getting them confused until we get to know them a bit better.

For now though our new arrivals are settling into their new home and making themselves right at home in all their new beds.
