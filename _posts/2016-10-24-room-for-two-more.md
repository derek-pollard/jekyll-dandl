If its not shopping for pet supplies its my other weakness, visiting the local RSPCA's website. And that's what I was doing when I happened across these two beautiful girls looking for a new home. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Bluebell & Buttercup" class="size-full wp-image-7783" title="Our two new rats, Bluebell & Buttercup" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/bluebellbuttercup.png" alt="Our two new rats, Bluebell & Buttercup" height="564" %} 

How could I resist?

Well, obviously I didn't because we headed straight out to the RSPCA and adopted them there and then! The girls had been waiting over a month for someone to adopt them, which is such a long time for little rats. Still their wait is over now, and we hope they are going to love being part of our family.

The plan is for the two new girls to live with our other four in a nice big cage, but for now we are giving them time to settle in. It was our intention to leave the girls alone for a day or two, but little Bluebell has other ideas. She is very much a live-wire and is already exploring her new home. There is no stopping her, and quite honestly I don't want to.
