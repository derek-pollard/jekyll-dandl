Digging up Cubbie's toilet!

Our cat Cubbie spends most of his day in our garden, we're convinced he never leaves. This means Cubbie has several outdoor toilet spots in the garden, which I keep clean for him. I just happened to clean one of Cubbie's loo spots the other day, which means it's full of nice freshly sieved soil, easy work for a troublesome bunny.

Derek has already filled the area back in twice and Fern just digs it out. The worst bit is we can't cover it in case Cubbie wants to use it. Goodness knows I wish he would it might deter Fern!

Oh what a crazy, naughty bunny we have.
