Every Saturday morning Derek and I treat ourselves to a milkshake. Not a fancy ice cream one, but some nice flavoured milk. We cycle out to the shops to do our weekly shop on a Saturday, so its a nice treat. Because we head out first thing shopping, its rattie playtime when we get back, which means we have to drink it with the Gems, so of course we have to share it with them too!

Things always start off well: {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Topaz, Sapphire and Ruby" class="size-full wp-image-9718" title="Three of our beautiful rats, drinking milkshake from a bottle top" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/post_9326.jpg" alt="Topaz, Sapphire and Ruby" height="521" %} 

But it doesn't take long for the silliness to start: {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Topaz and Sapphire" class="size-full wp-image-9720" title="Our rat, Topaz shoving her sister" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/post_9313.jpg" alt="Topaz and Sapphire" height="585" %} 

Oh they are silly girls and we do love them.
