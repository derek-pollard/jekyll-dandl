[Our little kitten](/cats/inkie/), Inkie, joined our family a few weeks ago. Although Fawn was friends with both our previous cats, Treacle and Custard, Derek and I were a bit worried that a boisterous kitten might be a bit much for him. We needn't have worried.

Fawn thinks Inkie is wonderful, we've never seen him so happy and bouncy. She harasses him while he eats, chases him and even tries to wallop him when he passes, and Fawn loves it! He really does. And if he doesn't appreciate Inkie's attentions, he turns on her and chases her off - it's pretty wonderful to see.

Bunnies look like such sweet little animals, but they know what they like and they are not afraid to stand up for themselves, that's what makes them so special.
