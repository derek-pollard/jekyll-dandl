After the drama of Blossom's surgery plus her dramatic and lengthy recovery, we were hoping for a simpler time with Maisy. Sadly Maisy made it quite clear this isn't going to happen.

Our lovely vet sending Maisy home with a rather fetching custom made t-shirt, to prevent her playing with her wound. Things started to go amiss almost as soon as she was home. Still heavily under the effects of her anesthtic, a very woozy Maisy got a bit excited when she realised she was back home. This resulted in a combination of things; she got very wriggly, her little back legs were flailing all over the place and she launched for the cage where Blossom was waiting. All this activity resulted in her fancy t-shirt getting caught in her feet and ultimately pulled down slightly. As rats have no shoulders there wasn't much hope of the t-shirt staying on, but it not even lasting until she was fully recovered from the anaesthetic was a little disappointing. With the t-shirt tangled around Maisy's back legs and putting pressure on her wound I had no choice but to remove it. Maisy did not cooperate, being as wiggly and grumpy as she could, while I had to cut it to get it down her body. Still, we both survived that and she slept peacefully the rest of the day cuddled up to Blossom.

Things seemed to be going well, but they weren't! It took Maisy only two days to remove most of her stitches. Luckily we had a follow-up appointment booked already and we had to turn up and confess what had happened. After Blossom's antics it seemed like the whole veterinary surgery knew Blossom and what a madam she was, so they were all very interested and amused to hear her sister was just as uncooperative.

Our vet was not surprised to hear of Maisy's indiscretion and had already planned on metal staples being the next line of defence. Surely she couldn't removed them...

To be honest it was slower going for Maisy to remove the staples, as she couldn't chew them, bend them or generally yank them out. No, these had to be worked out slowly and Maisy did figure out how to do it. She'd removed one of the two staples and had started work on the second when she had it removed ten days later.

None of this mattered when the remaining staple was removed and Maisy got a clean bill of health. Her wound had healed up perfectly, although Derek and I were still feeling the aftermath of all the stress those two pesky girls had put us through.

Now the girls are all healed all we can do is hope that none of the tumours return. We have a one operation rule for our rats, so if they do return we won't get them removed. Despite all the drama of the past few months I feel we have done the right thing for our girls. With the rate the lumps were growing I don't know how much longer they'd have survived, or if they'd still be here with us now. The trauma of gaping wounds, missing stitches and staple removal is a funny memory to us now. Oddly the staple Maisy removed turned up in my washing machine after washing the rats bedding, so we disposed of it safely, happy to know it can't cause any injury to any of our pets.
