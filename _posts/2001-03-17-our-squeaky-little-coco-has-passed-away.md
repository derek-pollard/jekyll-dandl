<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6596" title="Our sweet guinea pig, Coco" src="/wp-content/uploads/2001/03/post_DSCF1715.jpg" alt="Our sweet guinea pig, Coco" width="390" height="273" />Sadly Coco died and we miss the grumpy little chap terribly. He was having problems with bladder stones and it all got a bit to much for him. He had been to see the vet and was receiving treatment, but he took a sudden turn for the worse. I rushed him to the vet, but there was nothing to be done and he passed away in my hands before the vet even saw him.

It was a terrible shock. We kind of took Coco and Clipper for granted, they seemed such robust little chaps, spending their day chomping at the grass. We love them dearly, but they were happy with each other and were only interested in us when we had weeds or flowers to feed them. Even so we are going to miss Coco and the funny noises he and Clipper would make chattering to each other.
