Our sweet guy Pika passed away last night, and even though he and his brothers were a strange little bunch of hermits, we are missing him terribly. For the past week Pika had been under the weather, his breathing was a little wheezy and he wasn't eating, which was leading to weight loss. We were doing everything we could for him, including feeding him yummy babyhood, but sadly it wasn't enough and he passed away.

Although we weren't with our sweet boy, Derek had been in to feed the boys bread at tea time. He didn't get to see Pika, but he was cozy in his bed, and it was a few hours later I found him in the cage. There was no signs he had got into difficulties, the cage wasn't disturbed in anyway, it was more like he was heading back to bed and slipped away.

While I didn't have much physical contact with the boys, I did love to talk to them and watch them shuffling around their cage, and of course feeding them our dinner. Pika reached a good age living his quiet little life with his brothers, and while we had little interaction with him I'm pretty sure he was very happy and knew we loved him very much.
