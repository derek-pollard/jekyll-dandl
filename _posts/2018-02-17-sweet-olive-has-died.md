This post started out as an update about our girls, but sadly before I could post it little Olive passed away. Her condition has slowly been deteriorating since Cherry died and as much as we tried we couldn't help our little girl. She'd seemed initially happy to be reunited with Plum, and while there hadn't been any more trouble between them, Olive had become more and more reluctant to come out and play. We'd gradually been seeing less of her, and when she did make an appearance she seemed very scruffy and tired. At their weekly cage clean out, Olive would come out and seem quite happy to run around, but she wouldn't come out to play if she didn't have to. She was still keen for her teatime bread, and we had started feeding her bread throughout the day, just to see her and know she was eating.

Sadly it wasn't enough and at teatime, when Derek went to give the girls their bread he found Olive had passed away. It wasn't a huge shock, but we are still very sad to lose her. On a brighter note Plum still seems to be doing well. She is obviously confused to be alone, but we are spending as much time in the office, where her cage is, so she can hear us and we are there if she gets up and wants company.

Olive was always such a live wire, getting into places she really shouldn't including climbing on our heads! She'd find the tiniest gaps to get into, even squeezing up the back of furniture and appear looking down at us. There were no limits as far as Olive was concerned. For such a tiny creature she will leave a very big hole in our lives. Here a few of our little gerbils more crazy antics...
