Lindsay passed away suddenly and everyone is heartbroken.

### Jessies entry:

I don't know where mum is and I don't like it. The other night it was nearly time for bed when something happened and then some people came in the house and I got scared so I went and hid in my room. I haven't seem mum since.

Mum has fed me my breakfast every morning since I was little, but now dad feeds us all the time. I look all over the house and I can't find mum. Even though I don't like being outside very much I keep looking for her in the garden. I run round the house looking then I go outside and keep doing it but I still don't know where mum has gone.

Mum, dad, Inkie and me used to go out in the garden in the afternoon to play. When dad goes out I keep checking where mum sat and looking around nearby. I try very hard but can't find her. Dad keeps telling me it is alright and cuddling me. I started sitting on dad's knee and that makes me a bit less scared. 

Every night I liked to sit on mum's knee even if I was in the way of what she was doing. She didn't seem to mind and was always pleased to see me. Now mum's not there I don't know what to do or where to go. I'm confused and miss her.
