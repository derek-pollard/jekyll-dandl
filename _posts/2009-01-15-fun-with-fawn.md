[Our cat Custard](/cats/treacle-custard/ "Treacle & Custard"), who Fawn spent a lot of time with, passed away last month and I think Fawn has been missing him. Both Derek and I work from home, so we get to spend a lot of time with Fawn, but we had noticed that he wasn't spending as much time with us in the office as he used to. Instead we would often find him under our bed asleep or huddled in a corner of his room. He hadn't been playing with his bunny toys as much either and it was worrying me.

Seeing as my rats love playing with old boxes and large paper bags, and knowing how nosy bunnies are, I wondered if Fawn would too. So, I gathered up a cereal box, a paper carrier bag I got from a jeans store and some other bits and pieces and dumped them on the floor of our office. Then we waited for Fawn to notice.

At first Fawn looked at us like we were mad, but being a bunny he couldn't resist messing with all the rubbish. Seeing as the rubbish was such a success we moved some of his bunny toys from his room. It really has worked a treat. Fawn has started running around, charging from room to room, doing happy bunny hops and of course throwing things around.

Our cheeky little bunny has also started helping himself to rubbish out of the office bin!
