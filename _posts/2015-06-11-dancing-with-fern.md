It is hard to believeÂ our beautiful bunny has been with us for almost 8 years. While she is a little more laid back than she was as a youngster, she is still full of energy and life. We never know what kind of mood she is going to be in from calm and agreeable to energetic and in your face! Putting Fern away after a run in the garden is also an unpredictable business, if you leave her out to long she can be evasive and cross, but put her away too soon and she'll be incredibly stubborn and lead us a right merry dance. Get Fern at just the right time though and she is an absolute delight.

Here is our happy bunny on one such occasion.
