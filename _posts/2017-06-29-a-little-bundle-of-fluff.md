We've gone and done it now, after a bike ride up to the RSPCA we fell in love with a little black kitten called, Jessie, and I am very excited to say she joined our family today. I remember back when we fell in love with [Inkie and Cubbie](/inkie/), there was a pen of young black cats in the pen next to them, and a lady was visiting with them got swarmed by a pool of fluffy blackness. At the time we'd fallen in love with our little princess, Inkie, but I'd always remembered how adorable those little black cats were. After the sudden and shocking loss of our wonderful boy, Cubbie, my mind started to wander back to black cats. I found myself looking on the internet at little black cats for sale, they were so cute and fluffy even Derek found himself weakening to the thought of having a kitten.

Rather than rush into anything we decided to visit the RSPCA, just to see who they had looking for a home. Kittens are very sought after and older cats can be difficult to home with an existing cat, so we thought we were safe. As expected all the adult cats needed to be homed as only cats, but they did have five kittens. There were three black kittens a litter of two boys and a girl, plus two tabbies from a different litter. Four of the five kittens had been reserved, leaving a little black female looking for a home. While Derek wanted a kitten he wasn't too sure about a black cat, until he met Jessie. With Cubbie still very much in our hearts, we felt sure we had room for a little cat in our home. So we made arrangements to adopt Jessie. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Jessie (standing up) with the other kittens at the RSCPA shelter" class="size-full wp-image-7910" title="Four kittens playing" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/post_4560-copy.jpg" alt="Jessie (standing up) with the other kittens at the RSCPA shelter" height="663" %} 

That was Saturday, we had our home-check yesterday (Wednesday) and I picked up Jessie as soon as the RSPCA opened today! She is safely tucked away in our 'cats room' with lots of toys and beds to make her feel safe. We will take our time introducing her to Inkie, she needs to feel confident in her new home first, but fingers crossed with love and patience they will become great friends.
