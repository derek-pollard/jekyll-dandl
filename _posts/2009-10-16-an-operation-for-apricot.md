Not that long after the sad loss of our other rattie girl Pearl, after an operation to remove a lump, we had to go through another operation with our sweet little Apricot. Although I am pleased to say that Apricot has had her lump removed and is well on the way to making a full recovery.

Apricot's lump was under her right armpit and it was a horrible hard, hot and black thing. Despite all Apricot's health and skin problems we felt we had no choice but to have it removed. Even though the lump was very hard and immobile it was removed easily and after a good nights sleep Apricot was full of bounce and acting as though nothing had happened.

With the death of Pearl after a similar operation, and our concerns over Apricot's health before her surgery we are doubly thrilled that she is doing so well. Our little girl may not look like the most beautiful rat, but she is a fighter and we love her very much.
