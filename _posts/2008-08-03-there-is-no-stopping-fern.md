Our full of life little bunny is digging one serious tunnel. She is not digging near the edge of the garden, or about to dig under any plants, so we can't see any reason to stop her fun. Although we will probably have to stop her when we can no longer see, or reach, the end. We have already filled in the tunnel a couple of times, to slow her down, but it's no effort for Fern to empty it all out again.

The weather is really hot at the moment so Fern has to keep stopping for a lie down in the shade and we can see her panting from the exertion of her work. After a quick rest she is straight back to work.

She really is amazing to watch. Nothing is going to stop her in her mission, not even rocks. Our garden has plenty of stones and rocks and Fern is coming across her fair share while tunneling, but they don't hold her back. She will bite them and pull them out with her teeth. Fern just doesn't seem to care, not even when her mouth is full of soil. If she comes and sits beside us we can often hear her crunching soil between her teeth. It is pretty disgusting.
