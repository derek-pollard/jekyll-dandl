All is back to normal with our silly bunch of garden dwelling critters. Inkie is finished with her medicine, and while we still have her on bland food, she is 100% better and back to her naughty self. Fern and Cubbie are just as thrilled as we are with Inkie's recovery and the silly garden antics have resumed as normal. There is lots of bouncing, from all three of them, chasing and general silliness.

Derek and I have been working in the garden, getting ready for summer, and the silly gang have been busy helping too. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="The Silly Gang" class="size-full wp-image-6781" title="Our cats, Inkie and Cubbie on the garden bench with Fern the bunny underneath" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/post_0119.jpg" alt="Our cats, Inkie and Cubbie on the garden bench with Fern the bunny underneath" height="515" %}
