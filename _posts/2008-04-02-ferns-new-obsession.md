We have always known Fern is full of life, mischief and adventure, and we love her for it. She is great fun tearing around the garden getting into all sorts of trouble, climbing on everything she can find - including us. Now spring is here Fern has been gripped by a new bunny obsession - digging.

It started with the odd scrabble here and there, nothing serious. The ground was quite wet so digging wasn't much fun, but now the weather has brightened she's gone berserk!

We don't mind her digging - she is a bunny after all, but we are worried that she may dig her way out of the garden, so we'll have to come up with a way to stop her digging too near to the fence. Fortunately her favourite place to dig is along a brick wall where she has no chance of digging under, though I'm not sure how the plants that grow there are going to survive. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="'Go away I'm busy'" class="size-full wp-image-6288" title="Our bunny Fern digging a tunnel" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/post__1114.jpg" alt="'Go away I'm busy'" height="337" %} 

We fill her tunnels in every now and again, so she has to start again. Fern actually gets really excited when we start moving the soil around and plays with our feet and tries to stop us. She growls at us too, but it is all in fun. We know that if we ever made Fern mad she'd make sure we knew it.

Fern is such a bossy bunny!
