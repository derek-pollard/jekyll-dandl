Unfortunately while Fawn was having his vaccinations, our vet gave him a check-over and noticed his teeth weren’t wearing down evenly. This means that Fawn is going to have to have an anaesthetic and have his teeth filed down for him. We are very worried about this as he is far too young to be having problems with his teeth. Our vet told us it is becoming a common problem in rabbits, because the breeders don’t take good care of the young bunnies. To increase their profits they feed the growing bunnies poor quality rabbit food, so the baby bunnies don’t have all the nutrients they need to grow healthily, so their teeth don’t develop evenly. To add to this one of our previous bunnies, Jupiter, had problems with his teeth, it was much later in his life than Fawn, but he failed to recover from one of his anaesthetics, which makes what is happening to Fawn even more frightening.

We are trying to stay positive though, and even though Fawn doesn’t appreciate it we now have him on a completely hay diet. He still gets vegetables as a treat, but he no longer gets any bunny food, which he is not too impressed about. The hay we give him is very expensive, but he still manages to be picky with it. He is a very naughty bunny.

Derek has also started chopping hay up and putting it into a bowl, in an attempt to get Fawn to eat more. He actually really likes this and gets very excited when Derek is preparing him a new bowl. Though the cheeky little bunny does make quite a mess by chucking the bits he doesn't want to eat on the floor and leaving them.
