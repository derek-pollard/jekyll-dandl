The bunny run we bought Fern had, what we considered, a useful ramp up to the bed box. Obviously Fern did not agree with our assessment because she has removed it.

We went out to see her one afternoon and it was laying flat on the floor. Foolishly we thought it was an accident, assuming it had accidentally come loose somehow we stuck it back up. The ramp is attached with two screws and a metal plate so we screwed it all back together and thought our work was done. Fern had other ideas.

Obviously not impressed with our handiwork, Fern pulled it down again. I guess we are a bit daft, because we kept putting it back up and were trying to think of away to secure it permanently. Then we saw Fern actually lift it up and pull it down, not happy with her act of remodelling she flipped it over and started chewing on it. We finally got the message, so Fern's bunny run no longer has a ramp.

Fern is looking very pleased with herself and happily jumps up into the bed box without the annoyance of a ramp in the way. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Fern's handiwork: with her ramp and without" class="size-full wp-image-6290" title="Our bunny Fern in her bunny cottage, before and after she removed the ramp" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/post_ramp.jpg" alt="Fern's handiwork: with her ramp and without" height="381" %} 

We have a lot to learn about our headstrong little bunny.
