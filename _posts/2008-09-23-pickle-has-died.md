He started to slow down a few days ago, we couldn't even tempt him with baby food, which he had enjoyed the night before and was always one of his favorite treats. Gradually his condition declined until he died peacefully. He was very peaceful and even though we are going to miss him so much, it is good to know he didn't suffer. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="'What have you got for me?'" class="size-full wp-image-8383" title="Our rat, Pickle, checking out my hand for treats" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/post_1684.jpg" alt="'What have you got for me?'" height="476" %} 

Our Pickle was a very bouncy guy despite his age. He loved nothing more than coming out of an evening and bouncing round our home. He was a very happy rat who loved life and we couldn't help but smile whenever he was out. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="My three cuddly boys" class="size-full wp-image-8386" title="Three cuddly rat huddled in bed together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/post_1271.jpg" alt="My three cuddly boys" height="554" %}
