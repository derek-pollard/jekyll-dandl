<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6753" title="Our baby rat, Maple, sitting in my hands" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/post_10241.jpg" alt="Our baby rat, Maple, sitting in my hands" width="390" height="415" />I'm sorry to say that Maple's sneezing had started to cause us concern, so we put her straight on a course of Baytril. She was a very good girl and happily scoffed all her medicine, which we mixed in with baby food to make it more palatable for her. As she is so tiny, Maple was only on a small dose of Baytril once-a-day, so to make sure she was eating properly we made sure to give her several extra helpings of baby food throughout the day, some of which Kiki also enjoyed. Even when rats are fully grown they can lose weight and condition so easily, and we didn't want anything to happen to Maple, or Kiki for that matter, so spoiling them seemed the best thing to do.

After a week, Maple's condition had improved, and she was a lot brighter in herself. Both she and Kiki are mischievous little critters, and they love running around and seeing what kind of trouble they can get into. I am looking forward to putting them in with Dora, Tangy and Mitzi, not just because I'm sure they will love the big cage, but also the older girls are very quiet, and I hope that Maple and Kiki will help make them more adventurous.
