It isn't anything we need to worry about, he's perfectly healthy and full of bounce, but I have noticed that he is a bit shy and tends to get left out at play time.

Apple and Lime - who are pretty much identical in size and colour - are much more confident. When we open the cage door they will come pouring out to play or be handled and Bramble tends to hang back and then go to bed rather than shove his brothers out the way and get noticed. When out of the cage his brothers very easily take all of our attention.

So, we have been making an extra effort to encourage him. Its nothing special, we're just picking him up, giving him cuddle and putting him back in his cage. And when he's out and about we make sure we take the time to play with him. He's already much braver for it and he hangs around the door for longer giving us chance to get to him. When he's out on the floor he doesn't disappear under the furniture straight away either - and if he does curiosity soon gets him out again.
