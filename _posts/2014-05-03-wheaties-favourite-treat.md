We have a bread machine at home, and that means yummy fresh bread everyday. This is a favourite treat with many of our fuzzy family members, and Wheatie is no exception. Every day at teatime he is ready and waiting for his bit of bread, and he always sits right in the open doorway to his home and eats it.

Wheatie has settled in so well to life with our family. He likes to come out once a day to run around on the floor, and while he doesn't climb on us he does like us to sit on the floor with him so he can say 'hello'. When we got him Wheatie was quite skinny, but with all the digging and chomping he does, not to mention running around, he has put on a nice amount of bulk and looks like a proper healthy gerbil.

He really is a lovely little chap, we feel very lucky to have found him.
