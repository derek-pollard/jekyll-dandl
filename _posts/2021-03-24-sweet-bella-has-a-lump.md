Oh my, things are a little stressful right now. Bella has got a lump under her armpit, it is quite soft and squidgy, but after much deliberation we've decided to have it removed. At first we weren't sure what was the right course of action. As an adopted rat, Bella is very sensitive and we were worried how being away from home and her family would affect her. But the thought of losing her to a lump was too scary to ignore, so we have booked her in for surgery. Unfortunately, with the UK still being in lockdown and with Easter coming up, which is a big Bank Holiday in the UK, her surgery is still a few weeks away. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Bijou, Peanut and Bella" class="size-full wp-image-9773" title="Three little rats coming out of their cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/post_9155.jpg" alt="Bijou, Peanut and Bella" height="646" %} 

We are not worried about the size of the lump, as fortunately it is not growing too quickly and are taking comfort in the fact she is booked in. So now we can try not to worry about it for a few weeks.

With six rats it is hard to limit their food. I have bought some different rat food to mix in with their normal nuggets. Stashing food is very important to PomPom and Bella, they obviously weren't cared for properly in their first home and I sometimes wonder if they went hungry. Not that they need to worry now, I make sure they have plenty of food, because it stresses them if they get a bit low. These new nuggets are bigger and I thought it would give them something to stash, but maybe be harder to eat. It didn't happen that way, everyone went bonkers for the new food. Things have settled down a bit now, but time will tell if PomPom will slim down a bit.

Despite our concerns for Bella, the girls are all super happy, cuddly and enjoying all the extra attention of us being in lockdown gives them. It is hard to believe that Derek has been working form home for a year now, only a month after we got the girls. Lockdown may be a scary at times, but getting to spend all this extra time with all our critters has certainly been a very happy upside for us and the ratties.
