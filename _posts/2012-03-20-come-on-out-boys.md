Kapy and Powy are wonderful little guys, with one exception getting them out of the cage! Don't get me wrong they are very adventurous and playful rats, they just don't seem convinced by the world outside their home. Not even our old boy, Panda who comes and goes freely is enough to get them out. They watch him go, rather longingly, but don't follow.

Even more frustratingly the boys have started climbing up their cage when they come out, rather than on to the floor where they can run and play. We put their cage on the floor, next to the unit their cage normally sits on and they come out give a suspicious look at the floor then go up onto the unit and find nothing to do! Not even getting them out and popping them on the floor, near their home, can convince them.

It's not that I mind their silliness, I just get the impression they don't get it and as they grow bigger they need their world to expand with them. For now all we can do is encourage the boys and hopefully they will learn what fun the floor is!
