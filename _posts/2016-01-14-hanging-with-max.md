Wow Max is so much fun and he is winning out hearts very quickly. Our first degu is full of personality and has no difficulty letting us know exactly what he likes - and doesn't. When out of his cage he is very friendly and loves to come see us and sit on our knees, even if we're not giving him oats (his favourite treat). As he has learnt to come and go from his cage by himself we have no need to handle him if he doesn't want us too, which is nice. It's not like we have no physical contact with him, and have held and fussed him, but Max likes to be handled when he wants to, so we respect his wishes. If we do anything he doesn't like, he tells us rather than runs away, which is very funny. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Max enjoying his hammock" class="size-full wp-image-7239" title="Our degu, Max, snuggled in his hammock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/post_3188.jpg" alt="Max enjoying his hammock" height="378" %} 

The other day he was sitting on Derek's hand, eating oats out of his palm and I told Derek to stroke Max with his thumb. Max did not appreciate the attention and after warbling at Derek he took his back foot and stood on Derek's thumb so he couldn't fuss him anymore. Well, we think we have the smartest little Degu ever :-).

The other surprise about Max is how much he loves his hammock. When not playing, Max can be found lounging in his hay lined hammock. He really does love it and he makes little happy teeth grinding noises while snuggled in there. I guess because Max looks so much like a big gerbil we kind of expected similarities, but Max is more like a cross between our rats and bunny. He still lives in the old rat cage, which thankfully he hasn't even nibbled, but we do have a nice big cage for him. We just need a bit of time to make sure it is completely secure for Max. I've read a lot about degus escaping their homes, and while Max has shown no signs of trying to escape we can't be too safe, especially with two cats in the house.

Max's cheeky personality is fitting right in with our family. He comes out four to five times a day to play and run around our dinning room and has even found his way up onto our dining room table! He is a lot of fun and I really hope he is as happy with us as we are with him.
