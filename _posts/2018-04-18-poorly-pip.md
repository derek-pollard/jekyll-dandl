Oh my goodness our little Pip is having a rough time at theÂ moment. It started a week ago, I came down in the morning and could hear a degu complaining. I knew it was Pip, we can just tell their little voices now, and he sounded very upset. I went to see him and found that he'd hurt his back leg. It was nothing serious at first look. There was a very small graze on his left hip and it wasn't bleeding. Pip can always be quite dramatic about things, so we didn't panic and cleaned his wound with salt water, which he DID NOT appreciate, but it had to be done.

At first things seemed fine. He was messing with the wound, but we were keeping it clean so it seemed like everything would be okay. Then on Thursday, two days after he hurt himself, it was clean out day. We do all three degus in a row, and we missed cleaning his leg that day. Unfortunately we also had a workman in on the Friday, and that involved a lot of banging around. This got little Pip very worked up and when we came to get him to clean his leg he bit Derek!

We also saw that he had been playing with is wound and made a right mess of it. While it wasn't dripping blood there were a few drops of blood around his cage. First thing Saturday morning we called the vet and got Pip booked in. Poor little chap was terrified, not only was he in pain, but he's never left the house before. To make things harder on him, we had to leave him with the vet so she could give him a little bit of gas, to calm him down, and get a good look at his leg.

We were very happy to be reunited with the little guy late that afternoon. The vet had cleaned his wound and gave us some painkillers and antibiotics for him. Getting medicine into Pip is not the easiest thing, but we are battling him twice a day. Pip doesn't understand how serious it all is, but he is being a lovely boy. He can't have a dust bath at the moment, to protect is wound, but he still wants lots of fuss and cuddles, even though we manhandle him at certain points in the day.

All we can do is persevere getting medication into Pip and hope that he will leave the wound alone long enough for it to heal and give him lots of love.
