Things have been very up and down with our naughty little degu, Pip. We found that Pip's wound was self inflicted. It was a terrible shock, and we have spent most of the past year trying to find out why he was doing this to himself. Over the time Pip has been in and out of his collar, letting his wound heal and trying new treatments. We are now at the end of a very long journey and though we don't know if we will have a happy ending we are very hopeful.

Our vet has narrowed Pip's problem to a nerve issue with his spine. He is chewing his leg because he can't reach the painful area. He is on medication to help with the nerve pain and all we can do is hope and give our little guy lots of attention. So far he is doing very well and while it is not easy getting his medicine in him everyday, we are working out a routine. Derek and I prepare his medicine, cut up and crush is portion of tablet, mix it with water and get it into a syringe. Have a silly stand off with our noisy little degu, while he squeaks his objections before climbing into a cardboard tube, so we can wrap him up in a towel. Derek will hold Pip while I feed him his medicine a bit at at time. Then when we're all done Pip runs off for a bath and then enjoys some playtime. This is a daily occurrence and will be for the rest of his life, but if it keeps Pip healthy then it will all be more than worth it.

We are also concerned that Roo is suffering from the same condition. He has a habit of squeaking very loudly and spinning round in tight circle. It doesn't last long, or happen very often, nor does it cause him lasting distress, and thankfully he does not harm himself. We can only hope his condition does not worsen, because unlike Pip, Roo would not be agreeable to being picked up and given medicine.

For now though we are looking to a long and healthy future with our little degus.
