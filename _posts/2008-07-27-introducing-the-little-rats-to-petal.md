  - We have taken the first steps in introducing our lone rat, Petal, to our crazy new girls Daisy, Peach and Apricot. Things went pretty smoothly considering.

The main reason we were so keen to adopt Daisy, Peach and Apricot is that we have a [lone female rat, Petal](/petal), who is very lonely. As Petal is a rather mature rat it was our hope to find another rat nearer her age, once we saw Daisy and her daughters we couldn't leave without them. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Peach, Apricot, Petal & Daisy" class="size-full wp-image-8774" title="Four little rats out playing together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/post_1881.jpg" alt="Four little rats out playing together" height="421" %}

    When we introduced them for the first time Peach and Apricot were very shy and spent most of the time in their cage. Daisy, on the other hand, was much more friendly. In fact I think she was a little too friendly for Petal's taste and our old girl needed a lie down. I'm not sure if it is the heat that got to Petal or Daisy being a bit over excited, but we'll keep trying with the girls and hope for the best.
