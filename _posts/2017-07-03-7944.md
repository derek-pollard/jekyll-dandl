<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7945" title="Our little cat Inkie curled up asleep on the sofa" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/post_4605.jpg" alt="Our little cat Inkie curled up asleep on the sofa" width="390" height="313" />Our little Inkie is learning to cope without Cubbie in her life. She is looking much calmer since we've had her back on the Feliway and of course we are being super attentive to her, not that we didn't spoil our little cat anyway :-).

Another big change in Inkie's life is the arrival of Jessie. It all happened quite soon after the loss of Cubbie, but our little kitten is in no way a replacement for our sweet boy. Nor do we expect her to be for Inkie. We will take our time introducing the two cats, and Inkie is going to set the pace. At the moment Inkie is curious but a little scared of our new arrival. I'm not sure she knows what to make of the little black creature. They have seen each other several times, and there has been no aggression shown, which is good, although Inkie's response is to run away.

Jessie is still happy being kept in our cat room, which makes things simpler. She is slowly exploring the house while we are here to keep an eye on her, and supervise any interaction between the two. Apart from being cautious if we smell of Jessie, Inkie is happy to be in the house and sleep like normal. As tiny and precious as Jessie is, Inkie is still our number one princess, but we are hopeful the two will become good friends and Inkie will enjoy having a new companion to hang around with.
