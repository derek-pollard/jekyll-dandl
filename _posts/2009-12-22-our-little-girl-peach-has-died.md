Peach was very much a little live wire, always running around and bouncing, despite all the health problems that have plagued her most of her short life. Sadly in the space of two days Peach's condition deteriorated and she passed away. It was such a shock, one day she was bouncing around and playing, and the next she wouldn't eat and suddenly looked so frail.

Derek and I were with her when she passed away, so we at least know she was peaceful and were able to hold her. Just loosing our sweet little Peach is hard enough, but with all our other sweet guys who have passed away recently, including two of Peach's brothers, it is doubly difficult.

Still, we are looking forward to spoiling our little rattie family over Christmas, maybe letting them have a bit of Christmas pudding.
