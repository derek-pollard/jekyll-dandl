The boys have a hammock in their home that they never use and as the end of summer approaches I thought I would treat them a nice new super warm bed. I found these lovely fluffy lined hammocks online and knew they'd be perfect and I wasn't disappointed when they arrived. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="What's going on here?" class="size-full wp-image-6365" title="Two toy rats testing out Bandit & Wombat's new rattie beds" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/post_1091.jpg" alt="What's going on here?" height="267" %} 

After a wash I put the new beds straight in the boys cage, it took them a day or two to investigate them but when they did there was no getting them out, even though it's still summer! {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="The real Bandit & Wombat enjoying their cosy bed" class="size-full wp-image-6366" title="Ratties, Bandit and Wombat snuggled up in their fleecy bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/post_1274.jpg" alt="The real Bandit & Wombat enjoying their cosy bed" height="417" %}
