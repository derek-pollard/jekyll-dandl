<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-7395" title="Our rats, open wound healing nicely after 8 days" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/post_3358.jpg" alt="Our rats, open wound healing nicely after 8 days" width="390" height="579" />I am thrilled to say Blossom is making a full recovery from all her surgery troubles. Her open wound is healing up amazingly quickly and we are so relieved, happy and proud of our naughty little rat.

It has not been a easy time, Blossom has been carrying on as if nothing has happened, wanting to climb on everything and get in as much trouble as possible. She also wants lots of cuddles, but Derek and I have been a bit wary of handling her. Our main concern was touching the wound, it has not been pleasant. I really don't think Blossom cares, or is in any pain at all, but we both have a fear of poking our fingers in the wound, especially as Blossom is so wriggly.

There have been a few complications, though nothing serious, but Blossom has developed a few abscesses. So far they have been very small and have come and burst very quickly, leaving no serious wound. We're not too concerned and are not bathing the area as everything seems to be going well without our intervention.

For Blossom though she is just happy to be at home, with her sister and not having to go back to the vet. Not wanting to speak to soon, but everything is healing so incredibly well. It is hard to believe that just eight days ago she had a hole in her side and now the wound looks almost healed. We have been warned she will probably have a scar, and a bald bit of skin, but who cares, Blossom has survived what looked to us like a horrific experience and she is as happy as ever.

This has been the worst experience we have ever had with having tumours removed from our rats, and I am desperately hoping it will be a one-off as Maisy is, unfortunately, due to have her tumour removed soon.
