Our little Jessie is suchÂ a sweetheart. Like all little cats she loves to play, and get into mischief, but one thing Jessie loves more than anything else is her pop-pom toy. She's only allowed to play with her pom-poms when we are around, to keep her safe, and this seems to make it all the more special. Whether she is fighting with it, carrying it around, or trying to grab it while we tease her with it, Jessie is never far from her pom-poms.
