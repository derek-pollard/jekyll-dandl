Nothing you could put your finger on, he just wasn't his usual chattering, greedy self. We had been keeping him in the house anyway, because of the cold weather. He didn't seem to mind being inside, except when he found he couldn't eat the carpet, and it did make it easier for us to keep a close eye on him.

After saying “Goodnight” to him, like we always did before going to bed we had no real warning anything was wrong. The next morning I found him snuggled in his hay, like he'd passed away quietly in his sleep. It was a fitting end for our gorgeous chirpy and rather greedy squeaky guy.

We are really going to miss him and his noisy ways, he did get so excited at feeding time. After six wonderful years of his squeaking and warbling the house will seem very quiet. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Clipper and Coco in happier times" class="size-full wp-image-6602" title="Our guinea pigs Clipper and Coco, looking through the wire of their run" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/10/post_DSCF2061.jpg" alt="Clipper and Coco in happier times" height="445" %}
