We'd said goodnight to the boys like we always did and Panda was in his hammock all cosy and happy, but sadly when we came down and checked on him this morning he had slipped away. He looked pretty much like we'd led left him, so I think he slipped away peacefully in his sleep.

We fell in love with Panda, Polar and Tiny as as fully grown boys, who no-one else wanted. Though a bit shy when we got them, they all blossomed into gorgeous, fun and happy boys. We are so glad to have had them in our lives, and I like to think they enjoyed being part of our family as well. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="My big cuddly boys" class="size-full wp-image-10011" title="Our three cuddly rats snuggled in their hammock together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/post_2444.jpg" alt="My big cuddly boys" height="683" %}
