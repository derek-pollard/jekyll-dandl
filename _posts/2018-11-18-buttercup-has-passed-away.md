It is with a very heavy heart that I say our sweet girl Buttercup has left us. We tired very hard to get her better after her surgery, but it just wasn't meant to be. We could see Buttercup was starting to struggle with her wound and made the painful decision have her put to sleep.

Both Derek and I know it was the right and loving thing to do for Buttercup, but still it leaves us with a big empty hole. Buttercup was such a sweet unassuming girl. After being adopted and not too sure about us, she thrived living with her new sisters and became a very big part of our family. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="A young Buttercup and Lily" class="size-full wp-image-8751" title="Our two rats Buttercup and Lily peering out their cage door" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/post_5210.jpg" alt="A young Buttercup and Lily" height="421" %} 

Having gone from six crazy rats not too long ago, to nursing Buttercup we are left with our little fruitcake Lily. She has always been the strangest of the girls, preferring the company of other rats to us. Still, no matter how funny she is we are going to take extra special care of our little OAP, whether she appreciates it or not.
