I'm very sad to say that our sweet little girl, Tula has passed away.

A couple of weeks ago she started having breathing problems. We got her straight onto a course of Baytril and lots of baby food, but it didn't seem to help. Then to make matters worse we found a lump under her throat and it was a frighteningly fast growing one. In the space of two weeks the lump quadrupled in size. There was no way we could have the lump removed because of Tula's breathing difficulties. Our vet was also suspicious when he first examined Tula that her problems weren't caused by respiratory infection, and the rapid growth of her lump, even though it itself was not the cause, may well have been a symptom of more serious internal growths. Either way we had to acknowledge that there was nothing we could do to help our little girl.

Tula's breathing was becoming very laboured, and she was obviously being worn down by her condition. So, Derek and I made the very painful decision to have her put to sleep. Tula was so very young, and we really weren't ready to say goodbye to our sweet little girl. We can only know that she is at peace now and take extra special care of Tilly and hope to lessen her loss. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Tula & Tilly" class="size-full wp-image-9078 " title="My two little rats sitting in my hands" src="/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/post_2307.jpg" alt="Tula & Tily" height="449" %}
