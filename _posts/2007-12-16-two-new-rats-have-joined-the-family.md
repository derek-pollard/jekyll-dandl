Ooops we did it again! Another trip down the pet shop, for supplies, and we came back with more than we bargained for. The pet store need to take some of the blame for these additions too. We are normally very good at not looking at the baby animals when we go to the pet shop, but they had moved the baby rats to where the hamsters are normally kept and Derek caught a glimpse, then I had to look, then we had to go and see them, then a gorgeous little guy, Pepper, came up to see us and that was it.

There were loads of tiny little baby ratties in the tank, along with five slightly larger guys. Pepper was one of the older boys. Of course we weren't just going to get Pepper on his own, but as soon as I saw one of the bigger boys was agouti, there was no question who was coming home with Pepper. Our first rat, Crunchie, was agouti and so wild looking rats will always hold a very special place in our hearts.

As Pepper and Pippin were not tiny little babies they were able to go straight into our big rat cage. It is a really nice cage, but the bars are spaced a bit to far apart to keep baby rats in as they can just squeeze their way out. Our new guys were a bit overwhelmed, by their new surroundings, but as with all ratties naughtiness will soon take over.
