It is with a very heavy heart I write that both our sweet and bouncy little Peppy and our darling sensitive girl Bella have both passed away. Derek and I are still struggling with the loss of our two girls, combined with the passing of one of our degus, we are in a lot of pain.

## Peppy

We'd known Peppy was poorly for some time now and were just enjoying caring for her and making her has happy as we could. Just over a month ago we had noticed signs of weakness. Peppy was struggling to hold food to eat it and she wasn't quite as agile as normal. We suspected, and our vet agreed, it was probably a brain tumour, but other than problems eating hard foods Peppy was still happy and active. So we began supplementing her diet with baby food, which she loved, and keeping an extra close eye on her. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Peppy on Lindsay\'s knee" class="size-full wp-image-10309" title="Peppy on Lindsay's knee" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/post_8718.jpg" alt="Peppy on Lindsay's knee" height="585" %} 

Sadly Peppy's condition did continue to decline, slowly at first. She stopped eating rat food and limited herself to the downstairs of the rat cage. Our girls live in a big double story cage and downstairs there are tubes, a hanging bed and litter tray, so Peppy had everything she needed. We also gave her as much baby food as she wanted and started to give her broken up bits of breakfast cereal, which she enjoyed. As Derek works from home now, he was also able to keep an eye on her in case she needed anything.

Towards the end we did start to notice her getting more tired and she would often need help while eating just to make sure she didn't topple into her baby food. Then suddenly she seemed to lose all her balance making it hard for her to walk and we knew we had to let our sweet girl go. It was a hard decision, but of course we knew we had no choice and we took Peppy straightaway.

Peppy was always the most outgoing of her rattie family and the most unique. Right from being a baby she was wanting to explore, while her mums and sisters were still getting used to their new home. Peppy also had her odd eye and was a husky, her colour fading to completely white within a rather short space of time. To say we are missing her is an understatement - she was still a young girl and even knowing she was poorly we weren't ready to say goodbye.

## Bella

After the heartbreak fo saying goodbye to Peppy and the sudden loss of our degu, Roo, the last thing we expected was to loose another rat. Sadly on Friday night when we came to see the girls for their evening play we saw there was something terribly wrong with Bella. As Derek opened up the cage to wake everyone up, he found Bella flat out in one of the plastic igloos. We expected the rats might be a little more lethargic than normal, just because they'd recently lost Peppy. Sometimes they can be glum after losing a family member, just like us, but when I reached in to touch her it was obvious there was something wrong. As I lifted her out of the igloo I saw a dark stain around her bottom. Completely shocked at finding her like that, I thought the best thing was to clean her up, so I took her to the bathroom and gave her a very gentle wash. It didn't take much to clean her and she lay in my hand, not totally unresponsive but not resisting either. It was when I was towel drying her I realised something was terribly wrong. There was a large lump in her tummy. I was shocked and utterly heartbroken. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Bella sitting on the steps to their home" class="size-full wp-image-10308" title="Bella sitting on the steps to their home" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/post_0529.jpg" alt="Bella sitting on the steps to their home" height="585" %} 

As soon as she was dry I took her back to Derek and he confirmed that he could feel a mass as well. We knew what we had to do, the lump was deep inside her, where even if small enough it would be difficult to remove. All vets in our area were closed then, so I changed the paper bedding inside the igloo Bella had been in. Derek offered her some baby food, but she didn't want it. Only a few days before she, like the other rats, had been very interested in getting a taste of Peppy's food. Sadly she was now too poorly to care about yummy baby food, so all I could do was put her gently back in her igloo and try to make her comfortable.

Sweetly, one of the daughter rats, Pashmina went in to be with Bella and she seemed to enjoy that. Later that night when I checked on her PomPom was with her. The next morning as soon as they opened we called our vet and got an appointment. Although we are still unable to go into our vets building for appointments and have to talk to the vet in the carpark, we got a really nice vet who loves rats as much as we do. She was very sympathetic to our shock and took good care of Bella for us, confirming after she had passed there was a walnut sized lump probably inside her uterus. It was a little comforting to know that even if we had noticed it sooner there was nothing that could have been done without a very serious operation.

There is no way to know how old Bella and PomPom are, but we have had them over a year and a half now. So I do like to hope they are a good age and Derek and I did everything we could to make her new life with us as special as it could be and make up for the not-so-good start to life she'd experience before.

I remember the stressed little rat she was when she joined our family. Getting very possessive when I cleaned the cage out and how with time her face changed as she realised this was her forever home. She went from being quite stern to such a beautiful and playful girl who only deserved the best in her rattie life. It was such an honour to adopt her and be able to keep some of her babies with her, and I hope it made her as happy as she made us.
