When Inkie came to live with us she was a very stressed little kitten. She was very lethargic and was not washing or eating, so we bought a Feliway diffuser, which is a bit like cat aromatherapy. It releases cat pheromones into the air that help relax a cat. This worked a treat and the change in Inkie's behaviour and appetite was almost instant. The other change we noticed was in Inkie's eyes.

Inkie had a half asleep look about her; she even had it when we saw her at the RSPCA. Besides looking a bit narrow, Inkie's eyes also had a pinched look to them, like she was squinting all the time. We had assumed it was the way she looked, but as we get to know Inkie better we are realising it is brought on by stress.

You can see the difference in Inkie's eyes in the picture below. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Inkie's eyes: looking stressed on the left and happy kitten eyes on the right" class="size-full wp-image-6018" title="A comparison between Inkie's face looking stressed and much happier on the right" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/post_inkieeyes.jpg" alt="Inkie's eyes: looking stressed on the left and happy kitten eyes on the right" height="355" %} 

I am pleased to say that we hardly see this look anymore and everyday Inkie's confidence, happiness and mischief levels are increasing. She is a very beautiful little cat, who hasn't had the best start in life, and our little Inkie is a real treasure and we feel very lucky to have her in our lives.
