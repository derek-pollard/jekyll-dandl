I'm very pleased to report that the girls are starting to settle down a lot more. Yes Kiwi, Sugar and Pearl are still intent on chewing their cage, but they are a lot happier. We are able to keep the girls out for longer periods now and that wears them out so they have less energy for destroying their cage.

Our demon rat, Smudge, is also settling down. I've been making an extra special effort to pick her up and fuss her every time she is out. At first she made a right fuss and wriggled and squeaked, but she has gradually come to accept the attention and when I put her back down on the floor she'll go bouncing off, letting me know she is happy and enjoying the attention. The most important thing is she has stopped seeking my hand out and biting me, which shows she was starved for attention.

I'm not a huge fan of dumbo rats; I don't understand this need to change the look of an animal for no good reason other than for human amusement. Still Smudge and Muffin are sweet girls and they both enjoy bouncing around their room and playing.
