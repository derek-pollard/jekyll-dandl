Outside that is. We already had a cat flap from our previous boys, so once Inkie was all healed up after her little operation, and all the sulking that went with it, there was no reason not to let her out. There's a lot in our garden for Inkie to discover including our bunny, Fern and that was our first priority - introductions. I'm pleased to say that was actually pretty straight forward and once the initial curiosity had warn off, Fern went back to her chomping and Inkie went off exploring.

With a lot to learn about her feline abilities, Inkie managed to fall off a fence into a neighbours garden. I'm not really sure what she thought she was doing. There are some shrubs along the fence in our neighbours garden and we think she jumped for them, probably thinking they'd hold her weight, but they didn't and we heard Inkie fall through the plants and then silence. There was nothing we could do, so we left our little cat to it. Rather than be upset or scared Inkie obviously thought it was wonderful, as the next thing we knew she was tearing round the newly discovered garden. We had no choice but to leave our little cat outside to continue her adventures. Having never used the cat flap before, or shown much interest in it, we were very happy when a tired little cat made her own way into the house and curled up for a very long nap. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="The fence Inkie managed to fall off!" class="size-full wp-image-6226" title="Our cat Inkie sitting on a fence" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/post_2115.jpg" alt="The fence Inkie managed to fall off!" height="339" %} 

Inkie's confidence and interest in the outside world is growing every day. While it's difficult not to have our little cat around all the time, it's also great to see her blossoming into an adventurous cat, enjoying her life and freedom to roam.
