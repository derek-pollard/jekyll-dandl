Some very happy news! {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Daisy" class="size-full wp-image-8770" title="Our little rat, Daisy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/post_1725.jpg" alt="Daisy" height="282" %} 

We have been on the look out for a friend for Petal since we got her. It didn't seem right to get some babies from the pet shop. For one Petal's a little on the older side and might not appreciate some squirmy babies. If they didn't get on that would be another cage we'd need to buy. So, we called the RSPCA to see if they had any possible friends for Petal and they told us about a young mum and her two babies who had just come in.

When Derek phoned about the rats and he was told 'mum and babies' I had vision of some tiny little eepers, who wouldn't be suitable friends for Petal. Even so we went along anyway, and I'm glad we did, because 'mum and babies' are actually about six and three months old respectively.

Mrs Bumble (mum) and her two daughters Bubble and Squeek - as they were called - are adorable. They were in a large cage on the floor of the small animals building, snuggled up together in bed. As soon as we knelt down they came pooring out to see us and completely won us over.

Once home we settled them into a temporary cage - hopefully they will live with Petal - and left them to settle in. As we always do we gave them new names so Mrs Bumble, Bubble and Squeek became Daisy, Peach & Apricot. I think they suit them much better. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Peach & Apricot" class="size-full wp-image-8772" title="Our new little rats, Peach & Apricot" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/post_1603.jpg" alt="Peach & Apricot" height="520" %} 

While we were collecting the girls there was also a cage of three boys, who are Daisy's sons. It was hard but we felt it best not to bring the boys home with us. Instead we have decided to give it a few weeks to see if anyone else takes them, if not I'm sure we'll have some new arrivals to report on.
