When we got Max we read a lot about what social animals degus were, so wanting only the best for our new arrival, Pip and Roo soon joined out family. Our intention was with a lot of patience we'd introduce Max and the new arrivals and they'd live in a happy bunch just like we'd read about. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Pip and Roo in their new cage before they fell out" class="size-full wp-image-7450" title="Two degus snuggled in a fleecy bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/post_3368.jpg" alt="Pip and Roo in their new cage before they fell out" height="396" %} 

This no longer appears to be the case...

Pip and Roo have fallen out. When I say fallen out I mean, little Roo was getting attacked so badly that we found him covered in blood and not looking very happy at all. We separated him as soon as we realised what was happening and though we never actually saw Pip attack Roo, both degus are looking much better for being on their own.

We'd noticed a few scabs on Roo's back, but were wondering if it was mites as we'd seen no signs of violence between them. Then one morning we found Roo covered in blood looking very distressed. This video was taken of Roo a few days after we separated him from Pip, you can see some of his scabs and the poor state of his fur, though he was looking a lot better by this time.

After nearly a month on his own the change in Roo is amazing. Not only is his skin healing, also his once squinty eyes (which we thought this was just part of his features) are now open and round and he never shuts up chattering at us.

Even Pip has improved since being separated. His fur is now looking in really good condition, he's much sleeker and generally very handsome. When he comes out to play Pip now does little happy binkies, while running around.

Right now we don't know what is going to happen, our plan was to have three degus in one cage, or at worst two degu cages, but certainly not three separate cages! Of course we are committed to our little guys and will do whatever they need to keep them safe and happy, but right now we are questioning the wisdom of the advice that all degus need a companion. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Pip (left) and Roo after being separated" class="size-full wp-image-7454" title="Our two degus our and about" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/post_piproo.png" alt="Pip (left) and Roo after being separated" height="409" %}
