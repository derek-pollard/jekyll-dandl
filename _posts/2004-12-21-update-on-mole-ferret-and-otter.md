With Christmas fast approaching we thought an update on how our three boys are doing would be fun. It was a shock to all of us when Mouse died so suddenly and his sweet ways are still missed by us all. We are pleased to say that Mole, Ferret and Otter are all doing really well.

Unfortunately a couple of months ago Otter developed bumblefoot on his right foot. We keep it clean with TCP and have and emergency supply of Baytril in the cupboard for if it flares up to badly. So far we have not been able to clear up the infection completely, so at the moment it it a case of managing the wound. Otter seems to be ok coping with his foot and does not show any signs of it causing him pain, he still gets into trouble climbing places he shouldn't be. We have had to stop Otter running around on the carpet and now he and his brothers play on our bed. As they are getting quite old now they don't seem to mind the limited space on the bed and seem to enjoy snuggling down in the nice soft duvet. They really are a lovely bunch of boys, we still can't believe how much they have changed from the shy bunch of rats that we were given at the garden centre. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Ferret, Mole and Otter" class="size-full wp-image-7092" title="Our three rats huddled in a cardboard box" src="/wp-content/uploads/2004/12/post_3366.jpg" alt="Ferret, Mole and Otter" height="380" %}
