It seems very quiet in our dining room with just the three boys. We don't see much of the 'Granolas', but Pika is as sweet as always, turning up for breakfast and dinner. If it is something particularlyÂ yummy, one or both of the 'Granolas' will come down and enjoy our dinner with us, but more often than not it's just Pika.

We have changed their cage back to the smaller version and I have crammed all their beds into the smaller space not wanting to cause them too much disruption. I don't think they have particularly noticed the change. It certainly is better for me though, the large one was a devil to carry upstairs to clean, even taken apart.

As we head into the new year all I can do is keep an extra close eye on my boys and hope they will be okay. They are such shy little guys it can be hard to know what's going on with them, but I really do love and want the best for them, even if they are a bit silly.
