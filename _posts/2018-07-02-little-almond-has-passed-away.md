I'm very sad to say we lost our little Almond this morning. It wasn't a big shock as he'd been looking tired since his brother Acorn passed away last month. We'd moved him into a smaller cage, and that seemed to lift his spirits a bit. He was quite active in his new home and had started climbing on his wooden house for his bread, but we could see he enjoyed the simplicity of his new home.

He was an old guy though and with his teeth problems we suspected his lift in mood wouldn't last, and sure enough this morning he was looking very tired and a little out of breath. I picked him out of his cage and wrapped him in a towel and he passed away with both Derek and I holding him a few minutes later. Our little guy had been such a fighter, and we were happy he was able to slip away peacefully at home, knowing how much we loved him.

We will forever be amazed how brave Almond was, losing the end of his tail and living with his teeth problems for over a year. I cannot express what an amazing little guy he was and how proud he made me. With monthly trips to the vet to have his upper teeth trimmed, and living only on bread and broken up food - I would never have thought he'd live to such a grand old age.

All three boys were such an incredibly experience, we really are going to miss them.
