I'm not sure if Fern actually realises she is a bunny. Climbing on the furniture in the house was odd, but she is obviously a bunny who likes adventure, which is why she now lives in the garden where things are far more exciting, and tasty. Now she has started jumping on us, we really don't know what to think. It is not anything I remember the bunny books we read ever warning us about

When we let her out of her outdoor bunny run, we always like to stay out with her, even when its cold. Our main reason is to keep her safe, but we also just like being with her. Fern is a member of our family and it's fun to spend as much time as we can with her, plus as a lone bunny it is very important to make sure Fern isn't lonely.

We have two folding garden chairs to sit on and we go out with her twice a day, come rain, snow or shine. Obviously our presence is appreciated by Fern as she has started jumping up onto our knees and sitting there, like its the most natural thing in the world. We were really shocked the first time she jumped up and thought it was a one off, but no. If anything Fern is getting more confident sitting on our knees and climbing up us. Sometimes if she jumps up on Derek's lap she'll then hop over to me for a bit, before running of and kicking her legs and wiggling her ears as she goes.

Fern really is fantastic, if a little intimidating!
