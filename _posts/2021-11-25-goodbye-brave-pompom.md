Sweet little PomPom seemed to be making a great recovery. However today she lost a lot of blood again and had to be taken to the vets for the last time. It was heartbreaking to find her unwell again and have to say goodbye to another one of this beautiful group so soon. This is the first time I've had to say goodbye to anyone from our little family on my own without Lindsay.

PomPom was bright, friendly, gentle and although she wasn't the boss rat, she was the one that set the mood for the group. If PomPom came out to play then most of the others would follow. At nighttime feed she would wander the upstairs freely while the others were more interested in stashing the new food. As time went on she didn't go as far or stay out as long, but she loved her nightly treks, not taking any nonsense from the cats.
