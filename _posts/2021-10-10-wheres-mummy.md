Lindsay passed away suddenly and everyone is heartbroken. 

### Rocket's entry:

Everything got very confusing one night and I haven't seen mummy for a while. Daddy left us on our own for what felt like all day twice and we got very frightened. Even cuddling with Pebble didn't help me much and we are very confused. 

Before we lived here it felt like I'd had a poorly tummy forever but mummy used to say that the more she cuddled me the better I got. Daddy wasn't always convinced but he cuddled me just in case. It worked but my tummy is upset again and I hope it gets better soon.

Mummy also used to say that one day I'll have a growth spurt and I'll grow up big and healthy. I'm not sure what that means but I'm as big as Pebble now. I want to cuddle with mummy again.

### Pebble's entry:

We are scared and don't know what has happened. Everybody was so happy, Inkie didn't mind us saying hello, Jessie started getting to know us and mummy and daddy were with us all the time. Then mummy went away one night and hasn't come back. I remember when Rocket was tiny and very poorly so I try my best to be brave for him.

Mummy was always making up new games for us to play but daddy doesn't seem to remember them all so I have to help show him. If I keep pretending to play he catches on after a few goes and I like that. Rocket doesn't seem to mind what we play as long as he gets his tummy rubbed when he rolls over. He acts all brave but I know Rocket is upset.

Mummy loves us so much but we don't know where she's gone. Sometimes daddy seems to wonder where mummy is as well. He tells us she would come home if she could.
