<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6704" title="Our little bunny, Mars enjoying life as a house bunny" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/09/post_5712_IMG.jpg" alt="Our little bunny, Mars enjoying life as a house bunny" width="390" height="322" />After the sudden loss of his brother Mars was very lonely for several weeks, he would just sit squashed up against the back of the house. We both spent a lot of time with him in the garden, but of course we weren't Jupiter. Mars used to spend most of his time following Jupiter around the garden, they spent very little time apart and they would always disappear behind the plants together for a nap. It took a few weeks before Mars settled down and started enjoying being out in the garden again, though we did begin to notice he was getting tired, he just won't go for naps like he did with Jupiter.

We have adjusted the amount of time Mars spends outside now, even on nice sunny days he likes to come back inside after a few hours. His cage in the house is very large and of course we keep it very clean for him. So if Mars wants to spend most of his time indoors, who are we to stop him. He is seven years old now and we love him so much we are happy to do what ever he wants. Our sweet little Mars is still going strong and is looking very handsome for all the extra bunny beauty sleep he is getting.
