We knew little Peppy was a husky rat, that was very obvious when her silver streak completely disappeared and she ended up white, but I had never heard of odd eyes in rats before.

I'd always thought there was something off about Peppy's eyes. In certain lights one never looked that inky black you see with husky rats, but she's so bouncy its hard to tell what's going on. Then the other day she was sitting on my lap starting at me and there was no mistaking it.

Having never seen or heard of odd eyes before I checked some rattie forums to make sure I wasn't imagining it, and sure enough odd eyes is a thing. Our precious little, bouncy rat is an odd eyed husky -- who'd have thought? {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Her left eye is black and her right eye is red" class="size-full wp-image-9615" title="Our little rat showing off her odd eyes" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/post_8678.jpg" alt="Her left eye is black and her right eye is red" height="509" %}
