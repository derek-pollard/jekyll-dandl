At first Inkie wasn't too impressed with the new arrival, she was still missing Cubbie and it was warm enough for her to spend most of the day in the garden with Fern. As the days started to cool, she was forced to spend more time indoors and face the strange black creature that had taken residence. We were very lucky that is was a simple introduction, the last thing we wanted was to add t Inkie's hurt. At first she was indifferent to Jessie, making sure to ignore her and play up to us. Fortunately Jessie is a strange little creature and while she didn't harass Inkie, she did want to be friends. It didn't take much to wear down Inkie's defences and she couldn't resist watching Jessie play and chase her toys and Inkie was soon joining in.

Not only was it magical to see our two cats getting on, but to simply see Inkie enjoying herself again. She had been so down after Cubbie disappeared from her life, and of course we could not explain it to her. But with a rather strange little black cat to distract her, Inkie's mood picked up a lot.

The age gap isn't a problem, as Jessie is a sweet girl and she doesn't harass Inkie or want to play when Inkie's resting. She's quite daft so if Inkie does lose patience and clobber Jessie, little Jessie doesn't take offence at all, so fights don't escalate.

Inkie is a fussy sleeper and goes through fazes where she has a favourite bed, sometimes this has been somewhere Jessie likes to sleep. Jessie just excepts the bed is taken and finds somewhere else to nap, which makes Inkie feel very important. Both Derek and I are aware that Inkie is a little spoilt, there have been times we've not even moved her from chairs we wanted to use. Sweet Cubbie was as soft on Inkie as were are, so it fits well that Jessie isn't pushy either.

It is wonderful to have our happy little Inkie back, and to know introducing a new kitten to the household only helped her cheer up is a great feeling.
