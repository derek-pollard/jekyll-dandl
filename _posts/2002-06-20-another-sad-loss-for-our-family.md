<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6510" title="Our little gerbil, Barely nibbling an apple" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/06/post_4557.jpg" alt="Our little gerbil, Barely nibbling an apple" width="390" height="296" />Our sweet little Barley has died. Last week she had been taken ill with a respiratory infection. We took her straight to the vets and got her some medicine.

Barley was very brave trying to join in with her sisters when they came out to play, but she was very, very poorly. It was incredibly difficult to see our adventurous and active little girl struggling and when it became obvious she was not going to recover we had to make the difficult decision to take her back to the vets and say goodbye. It was a very sad day, we buried her in our back garden near her sister Rogue.

Even though Barley had the biggest personality of the four gerbils, and was kind of our favourite, we are still taking extra special care of our two remaining little old gerbils, Syrup and Millie. They are very sweet and undemanding, compared to their two sisters, but we love them very much and are enjoying spending time with them without the boisterous distraction of their sisters.
