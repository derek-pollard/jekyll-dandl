We've had to say a sad goodbye to our gentle little Cookie. He had lost some use of his back feet, although he didn't let it get him down or stop him getting around his cage. Unfortunately old age caught up with him and in the space of twenty-four hours his condition deteriorated drastically, he became very confused and his breathing very laboured. We made the very sad and difficult decision to take our little Cookie to the vet and have him put to sleep before he really began to suffer.

Bourbon, Cookie, Coral and Clover were our first experience of adopting ratties from a homing centre and while at times they were hard work, we really do miss them very much. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Bourbon, Cookie, Coral and Clover helping at clean out time" class="size-full wp-image-7187" title="Our four rats helping at clean out time" src="/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/post_3665.jpg" alt="Bourbon, Cookie, Coral and Clover helping at clean out time" height="533" %}
