<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6579" title="Our cat, Treacle relaxing in the garden" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/post_5040.jpg" alt="Our cat, Treacle relaxing in the garden" width="390" height="285" />Oh my goodness, Treacle did have bad stinky breath! It was not pleasant, so we took him down the vet and booked him a dental.

He had his dental a week ago yesterday and came through fine. He was a bit wobbly and spaced out from the anaesthetic when we got him home, but it wore off by the next morning. Fortunately he didn't need any teeth removing, but he did have some inflamed gums. He's been on a course of antibiotics to help with that.

The most important thing is his breath no longer honks and he is much happier. I feel really bad that I let it go on so long, but the smell kind of snuck up on us and I've been a bit focused on my rats. I know I have been a very bad kitty mum, and I'm very sorry, but I think Treacle has forgiven me.

Our little old cat is looking forward to the summer now, and is already spending more time sleeping in the garden.

We still miss our tubby guy, Custard. Over a year later and I can’t believe he's gone, but Treacle is still in good health so we are very grateful for that – especially now his breath doesn't smell.
