<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6695" title="Our dwarf bunny Jupiter sitting on the lawn" src="/wp-content/uploads/2002/06/post_dscf0216.jpg" alt="Our dwarf bunny Jupiter sitting on the lawn" width="390" height="324" />Jupiter needed an operation to have his back teeth clipped and unfortunately he did not recover from the anaesthetic. Jupiter had been having problems with his back teeth for some time and we regularly took him to the vet to get them checked. The call from the vet came as a big shock, we were expecting them to call and say he was fine and we could bring him home.

Jupiter had been with us for just over 6 1/2 years and we were in no way prepared to loose him. While we love our other 3 bunnies dearly, things just won't be the same without Jupiter, he was such a special little bunny. It is going to be hard getting used to his absence, and we will take extra special care of his brother Mars as we don't know how the loss of Jupiter will affect him. Jupiter was an exceptional little friend we will miss him and all his naughty little habits very much.
