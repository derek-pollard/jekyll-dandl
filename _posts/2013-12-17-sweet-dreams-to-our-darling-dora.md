She suddenly took very poorly, struggling with her balance and coordinatingÂ her limbs. It was very similar to the symptoms her two sisters had suffered from earlier this year and while it was dreadful to see our beautiful Dora struggling like that we knew what we had to . We're guessing all three girls suffered from some kind of neurological issue, which while upsetting we are grateful that Dora managed to live a long and happy life before being taken ill.

Our Twiglets were gorgeous girls and though they were slightly timid when we first had them they grew, with the disruptive influence of Maple and Kiki, into beautiful princesses. Showing us that while they were almost identical in appearance they had completely different and charming personalities.

Now Maple is on her own we shall be extra attentive to all her needs. She is a very gentle, patient and loving little rat, and having suffered through the loss of her four sisters we don't know what the future will hold for her. One thing is for sure, she will be receiving lots of extra cuddles and rattie treats for the rest of her life. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Baby Twiglets" class="size-full wp-image-10041" title="Three baby rats peeking out of their hammock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/post_3060.jpg" alt="Baby Twiglets" height="407" %}
