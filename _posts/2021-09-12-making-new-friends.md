As Jessie is pretty much a house cat, we knew the kittens would have the biggest impact on her.

With this in mind we've been taking the introductions of Rocket and Pebble very slowly. When you adopt a kitten from the RSCPA they advise you to keep them in secure room for a few days, just to find their feet. This also gave Jessie plenty of time to get used to the smell and sounds of the new arrivals.

At first when Jessie would pass the kittens' room she would sniff at the closed door and fluff her back and tail up. This lasted a few days and then she seemed quite curious, that was until she actually met them. The first few face to face encounters with the kittens made Jessie run away. As they hadn't made their way downstairs at this point it was easy for Jessie to get away from them.

Jessie is a very sedate cat so two bouncy little kittens were always going to be a bit of a shock to her. They were both interested in Jessie, which did make her nervous, but we kept them under control and stopped them harassing or chasing her. We also decided to put a Feliway Friends in the room Jessie sleeps in most. This is supposed to release happy friendship pheromones. I can't say for sure if this had an impact on the introductions, but Jessie did seem more at ease when watching the kittens.

With the kittens being so small, Jessie had the advantage of being able to jump to places they couldn't, so she was able to sit and watch them from a distance. This went on for about a week, with Jessie seeming more and more interested.

Then last night something quite strange happened. I was sitting at the top of the stairs with the kittens, and Jessie was at the bottom looking up at me. There was a playful glint in Jessie's eyes. Now Jessie is not normally the most playful of cats, but you never know so I wiggled my finger tip over the top most step. Jessie hunched down, wiggled her bottom, charged up the stairs and tapped my finger before disappearing into a bedroom. I was shocked, even the kittens looked amazed!

After a few seconds of being out-of-sight Jessie went back down stairs and did it again, tapping my finger as she came back up! I thought it was rather wonderful, there's not an awful lot of playtimes with Jessie so this was an extra special treat. This time when she went downstairs, she did have a little lie down, but then she was back at the bottom step before running up and touching my finger. Three times was her limit, but we were very hopeful it was sign of her relaxing.

Then the next morning, three weeks exactly after the kittens joined our family, we found this... {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Pebble, Rocket and Jessie" class="size-full wp-image-10170" title="Our two kittens and older cat, Jessie on the bed together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/post_7346.jpg" alt="Pebble, Rocket and Jessie" height="503" %} 

It was the first time Derek and I had left the house and not shut the kittens away in their room. We'd only gone a little walk and they were already on our bed looking very comfy. Jessie was also in our bedroom looking very relaxed from her vantage point high up on a drawer unit. So, we took a chance of leaving everyone alone together and it worked out far better than we ever could have hoped. We are so proud of Jessie for accepting the kittens, especially so quickly, she is such a brave girl. Now we just hope she doesn't teach them any of her silly Jessie habits.
