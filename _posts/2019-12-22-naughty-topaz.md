<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/post_7909.jpg" alt="Our sweet rat Topaz" title="Our sweet rat Topaz" width="390" height="251" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9442" />First off, she is fine and healing very well after her surgery, with no thanks to her own naughtiness. As suspected Topaz did open up her stitches. It turned into a constant battle trying to distract her from her wound, one Derek and I lost. Still, Topaz is doing fine, she's been on pain medication and antibiotics, so we just had to focus on keeping her wound clean.

I don't know if it's because she's so young or not having the wound restitched helped, but Topaz is healing up quickly. Our vet did want to restitch the wound, but we decided against it. Having been through this before with our naughty girl Blossom, we were concerned she'd just open the stitches again, plus the stress of another anaesthetic. Who knows what the right thing is, but Topaz is happy and her wound is closing up well.

Out of the Gems, Topaz is the most active and that has not changed with all this upset, though I think it was Derek and I who are most concerned. We will continue to keep a very close eye on our naughty little girl and on all our girls - they are so beautiful and precious even if they're not all as active as I would hope, but that's another story.

We have no previous experience of tumours in such young rats and whether it increases the chance of a new tumour growing. For now though we are grateful that she is happy, healthy and none the worse for her ordeal. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Sapphire, Topaz, Opal and Ruby being silly over milkshake" class="size-full wp-image-9444" title="My four sill rats enjoying treats" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/post_8003.jpg" alt="Sapphire, Topaz, Ruby and Opal being silly over milkshake" height="644" %}
