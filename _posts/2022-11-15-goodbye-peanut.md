Peanut has had a growth on her side for some time. Even when it became quite large it didn’t hamper her mobility and she had been getting about easily, using both floors of their home. More recently she developed a second noticeable growth on her other side. Sadly the larger growth reached a size where it was starting to affect her balance while eating and cleaning. I could not deny that it was close to being an issue even though she still appeared happy. When checking her over I found a third lump forming which at least confirmed that I was correct not having the first one removed at her age.

Despite not wanting to, I made the decision to say goodbye to Peanut before her health and happiness were impacted. When the time came I didn’t want to take her away from her home and Bijou but I knew I shouldn’t put it off for her. The vet was very kind and understanding, letting me hold and comfort Peanut while she drifted off to sleep. 

Peanut looked a lot like PomPom, who was probably her mother, although they had quite different personalities, PomPom being brave and outgoing while Peanut was shy and quiet. They were both sweet and gentle though. 

I’m taking extra care of Bijou now that she is all on her own, checking on her more often and giving her a few more treats so she knows she’s still cared for and loved. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Peanut checking their home after clean-out last week" class="size-full wp-image-10480" title="Peanut checking their home after clean-out last week" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/post_6851.jpg" alt="Peanut checking their home after clean-out last week" height="520" %}
