<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8758" title="Our sweet degu, Max, enjoying a lie down" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/post_0044.jpg" alt="Our sweet degu, Max, enjoying a lie down" width="470" height="409" />I am really shocked to say that our sweet degu Max has passed away. He started passing blood in his urine a few months ago. We took him straight to the vets and got him medicine, and it cleared up quickly. The blood was put down to an infection and we didn't think any more about it. Max was happy and playful, so life carried on.

Sadly it wasn't as simple as we had hoped and a few days ago max took a turn for the worse, and then the blood returned. Somehow we managed to get a urine sample off him, which our vet tested. The results were inconclusive, there was infection and some sugar, but nothing that pointed to why he was so poorly. We got him straight onto strong painkillers, antibiotics and an anti-inflammatory, all in the hopes of making Max feel better. Sadly they didn't help and Max passed away at home.

He was so poorly he was refusing to eat, and didn't want to move around even in his cage, never mind coming out to play. We moved him into a pet carrier, padded with towels to keep him warm and safe. Poor sweet Max was so poorly he didn't care. Alongside his medication, I was trying to syringe him water and mushed up food, but Max didn't really want any of it. We had an appointment to take him to the vet the day he passed, but he slipped away quietly. I was beside his box for most of the day, wanting to be there if he needed me, but Max wanted to be left alone. He was weak, but peaceful at the end, and both Derek and I can only hope he knew just how much we loved him.

Our little Max loved to tell us just how he liked things, and cleaning out time was no different. He loved to make sure I was doing everything right...
