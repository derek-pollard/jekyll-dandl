  - Our cubby little rat, Toffee, had been very lonely since the loss of his two brothers. Luckily for us our local RSPCA had two boy rats looking for a new home.

After a few months of being on his own, it became obvious Toffee was not a happy boy. He wasn't eating much, not like Toffee at all, and he didn't want to get up and see us. It was breaking our hearts seeing him so unhappy. So we set about finding him some new brothers. As luck would have it our local RSPCA had two older male rats looking for a home, so we went along to meet them. We took one look at the two rats and knew it would be a match made in heaven.
