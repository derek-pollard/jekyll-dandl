<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-8947" title="Our rat, Daisy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/post_3686.jpg" alt="Our rat, Daisy" width="470" height="290" />Daisy's lump had gotten to a size where it was beginning to cause her problems. It was affecting the mobility of her arm, if she jumped down off something she couldn't bring her left arm forward and would land on her face or the lump itself. The lump itself was also starting to ulcerate; the skin being stretched too taut causes this. So we made the difficult decision to take her to the vet and have her put to sleep, before she really started to have more serious problems and risk the lump getting infected.

We took her last Friday afternoon and it was a very difficult day, we love our Daisy so much, and she was such a funny girl and has given us many happy memories. To make things worse we also had to have one of our [boy rats, Conker](/chestnut-conker/), put to sleep earlier that morning.

Things just arenâ€™t the same without our spooky little girl, she was such a funny little rat but we love her so much.
