Rocket and Pebble have been with us two weeks today! To make it extra special little Rocket came downstairs for the first time this morning.

Yep, for the past two weeks Rocket has confined himself to the upstairs. Pebble being much more adventurous, started coming down last week, leaving Rocket behind. The poor little guy would find himself without his sister and sometimes cry for her. Of course this got Derek and I running to his aid, which he thought was rather wonderful. However today he came all the way downstairs and immediately discovered the two huge cat posts we have in the lounge and climbed straight up them.

Having Rocket with her also gave Pebble extra confidence and she was much more adventurous in her exploration. They were so happy to be downstairs together they settled down on one of the cat posts in the sunshine. They are both curled up asleep as I write this.

In other very exciting news, Inkie and Jessie are happy and relaxed in the kittens presence. It is always a worry when you bring any new animal into the house that everyone will get on, especially with new cats. Jessie was a little flustered at first by the rather excitable kittens, as she is a rather sedate cat, choosing to spend her days relaxing round the house rather than going outside. Our senior cat, Inkie, isn't really bothered, she'd seen it all before when Jessie came along and provided nothing interrupts her garden snoozes she's happy.

We do have a couple of Feliway defusers in the house. A Feliway Classic in the room the kittens were originally kept in, to help them relax and a Feliway Friends on the landing just to help ease any tension between everyone. I'm a firm believer in the effectiveness of Feliway after the effect it had on Inkie, so I like to have them plugged in and ready before there are any problems.

Our little kittens have their booster vaccinations tomorrow, so hopefully they will cope well with that and continue to grow and explore their new home.
