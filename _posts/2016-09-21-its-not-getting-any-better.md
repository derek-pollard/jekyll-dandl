Oh my goodness, Fern is still at it. Our only consolation is she has moved on from digging up Cubbie's loo and is now undermining our rubbish bins!

I was in charge of our wayward little rabbit when this happened. I naively thought she was sleeping or chomping the afternoon away in the garden. But no, when I went out to throw some rubbish away I was confronted by this, and a very tired little rabbit.

The mess had to wait until DerekÂ got home from work. It may have taken one bunny to make, but filling the hole back in and separating the gravel from the soil was a two-person job.

We are strangely proud of Fern, not that we'll tell her. But the level of destruction she is achieving at the grand age of 9, and after being so poorly earlier this year, is very impressive.

Oh Fern we do love you, but can you please give it rest.
