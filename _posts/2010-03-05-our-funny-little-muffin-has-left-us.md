More bad news I'm afraid. Muffin had what we initially thought was an abscess on the side of her face. The lump came up very quickly and burst within a couple of days, as you would expect. We immediately started bathing it with salt water and giving her Baytril. Not all of the swelling went down with the burst abscess and worryingly a strong smelling fluid was starting to discharge from Muffins ear. Her jaw had also gone out of alignment, with her bottom teeth pointing diagonally to the right, making it very difficult for her to eat even baby food.

We consulted our vet, and she speculated that Muffin has some sort of fissure, which was causing the fluid in Muffins ear and probably draining into the abscess. As we sadly expected, she told us we could do nothing more for Muffin than what we were doing.

Our little Muffin was obviously very unhappy, and not her bouncy little self at all, so we made the hard decision to have her put to sleep. I've never been a big fan of dumbo rats, but Muffin did win me round. She had the sweetest little personality and she was just so full of fun and life. Right up until she got sick Muffin would spend her playtime running round and round the room. She would regularly run into a table leg, us or another rat, but she'd just pick herself up and carry on running.

I had always hoped Muffin would live to a good old age and pass away peacefully in her sleep. It seemed fitting for the simple way she lived her life. Sadly things didn't work out that way for our little girl, but I'm pretty sure she had a great time being a much loved member of our family {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Muffin with her rattie family" class="size-full wp-image-9050" title="Five rats squished into their hammock together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/post_3408.jpg" alt="Muffin with her rattie family" height="597" %}
