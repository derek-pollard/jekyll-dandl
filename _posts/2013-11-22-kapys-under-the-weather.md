<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6435" title="Our poorly rat Kapy enjoying some cuddles" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/post_1988.jpg" alt="Our poorly rat Kapy enjoying some cuddles" width="390" height="204" />We're taking extra special care of our guy Kapy at the moment. He's always been a bit of a scruffy boy, he lost some condition after his brother died and he never really got it back, but lately he's taken a sudden decline. There has been no real noticeable drop in his appetite, but he has gotten very thin and his fur even scruffier. We've been feeding him baby food, which he loves and hopefully it'll help build him back up and give him the strength to get through whatever has made him poorly.

For now though we are spending lots of time cuddling our poorly boy and hoping all our love will help make him feel better soon.
