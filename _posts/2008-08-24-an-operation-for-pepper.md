Pepper has had a little lump on his right shoulder for some time. The size and shape of the lump has never changed since we first discovered it, and so we decided to leave it alone and see what happened. A few days ago we noticed the lump had increased in size, not by much, but enough to make us take notice.

Yesterday we took Pepper to our vet and got him checked over. Our vet agreed with us, that while the lump looked and felt quite innocent - most likely a cyst or fatty lump rather than a tumour - as it had increased in size it was best to remove. Pepper was booked in for surgery the next day.

Even though Pepper and Pippin are both large rats, they are very gentle guys. Pepper was upset enough going to the vet to be checked over, so taking him and leaving him for his operation was very hard on all of us. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Brave Pippin" class="size-full wp-image-8418" title="Our rat, Pippin, showing off his surgery wound" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/post_2434.jpg" alt="Brave Pippin" height="389" %} 

We were very happy to go and collect Pepper. He was fully recovered from his anaesthetic and once home only interested in eating. Pippin was fascinated by Pepper’s wound, but he only sniffed at it so we don’t have to worry about him chewing Pepper’s stitches. He has to go back in 10 days to have a check-up and his stitches out, but that’s routine.

Now he’s home Pepper doesn’t seem any the worse for his ordeal. I wish the same could be said for Derek and me.
