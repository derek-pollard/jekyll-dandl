Topaz is the craziest of the bunch. She was the first out their cage exploring and now she has her confidence up she dominates playtime. I love having a crazy happy rat running around, but she can make it difficult to get to know the other girls. Sapphire is doing okay, she's not that far behind Topaz in the crazy, adventurous stakes, but Opal and Ruby are a little more reserved. They both love to come out and play, but they do get a little overwhelmed when Topaz, who has managed to climb something, drops down unexpectedly or goes bouncing past giving them a fright.

Topaz's crazy ways can also make interacting with Opal and Ruby difficult. She's one of those little critters who has to be the centre of everything, so when we reach for one rat we get a handful of Topaz, and if we try and ignore her she'll just climb on us anyway. Oh we are loving life with Topaz, but I would like to give a bit more attention to my two shy girls. Still, they are all only babies and I know how these things work, before I know it there will be all four rats climbing over me looking for treats and cuddles.

The other not very serious problem we are having is the girls are all so fast, or maybe Derek and I are just getting a bit old! Either way, we are struggling to get any pictures or videos of the girls running around. Videos just tend to be the tip of a tail as we try and track someone bouncing around or the blur of a rat coming to see the camera. Crazy Topaz also loves the silicone cases our phones are in, so we spend a lot of time defending our devices from rattie attacks. What fun :-)
