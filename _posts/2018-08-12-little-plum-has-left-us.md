It feels like the end of an era with the passing of the last of our beautiful little gerbils, Plum. She has been doing surprisingly well on her own since her sisters, Olive and Cherry passed away at the beginning of the year. She stopped wanting to come out and play with us, but was still happy to interact with us in her cage, especially if we had some treats. In all respects she seemed very happy and healthy. Then two days ago we noticed she was looking a little breathless. It wasn't bothering her and she could still get around her cage fine. Just to be safe I began giving her baby food, to make sure she was eating plenty and she slurped it up. With yummy baby food three times a day, plus all her other treats she was loving all the extra attention.

Sadly though it couldn't last, and we were with her Saturday morning when she got up and looked a little uncomfortable. I got her her straight out the cage which helped calm her down, but a few minutes later she passed away with both Derek and I holding her. We are incredibly sad to say goodbye, but she had a good long life.

Plum and all her siblings were such a wonderful experience and we cherished every moment we had with our little guys, things just won't be the same without them. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Our girls cuddled up together" class="size-full wp-image-8535" title="Three gerbils cuddled up asleep" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/post_0104.jpg" alt="Our girls cuddled up together" height="591" %}
