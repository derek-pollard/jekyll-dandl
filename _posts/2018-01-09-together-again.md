I'm pleased to say little Olive and Plum are back together in the same cage again. We took reintroducing the girls very slowly, but seeing as neither of them seemed happy apart we knew it had to be done. As Plum was in one of our spare gerbil cages, we decided to put them together in this cage, rather than the one they'd shared with Cherry and had fallen out in. Friday afternoon I let them out together in the office, just to see how they reacted to each other. Things were tense but there was no aggression between them, so when I put them away I popped them both in the temporary cage together. I spent the rest of the afternoon watching them, and apart from some confusion as to where they were they seemed happy. By Saturday they were still getting on, so I took their old cage apart and gave it a thorough clean, even disinfecting the wood. My hope was that removing any trace of Cherry would help the girls resettle into their old cage, as her passing was obviously what had triggered the aggression between Olive and Plum.

Sunday afternoon is the regular clean out day for all my gerbils, so Derek and I had the girls out on the floor while I put their home back together. They were very interested in helping me, which was nice. Once it was done, Plum was straight in and exploring. Olive took a bit of convincing, but she had some sunflowers once she was in. We still continued to keep an eye on the girls. Olive still seems a little unhappy, but Plum is very happy to be back in their home.

Time will tell how the girls will cope without Cherry. She was such a large part of all our lives, it is easy to understand how her passing has impacted her sisters. For now we are taking extra special care of Plum and Olive making sure they know how much we love them and hopefully that will be enough to get them through this difficult time.
