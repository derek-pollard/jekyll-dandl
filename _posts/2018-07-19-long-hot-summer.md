Oh my goodness we are having a bit of a heatwave and Fern is not impressed. Normally during summer, Fern is happy to hide away in the garden to avoid the midday sun, but this year it is really hot and the ground is just scorched. We have resorted to putting our gazebo up over her run to keep the sun off it, and fortunately even though the temperature is still very high, it is creating some relief for our bunny. We are still keeping a very close eye on Fern, and if it does get any hotter we will have to think about bringing her inside, not that she would appreciate that. Fern is a very stubborn and bossy bunny and she makes it very clear she is a wild, outdoors bunny. Fingers crossed this intense heat won't last, this is the UK after all!
