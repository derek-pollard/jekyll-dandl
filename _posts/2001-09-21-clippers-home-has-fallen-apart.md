Clipper is still happily munching his way through the garden. Unfortunately his run fell to pieces the other day, it had been getting a bit shabby (not helped by the cats sitting on it and using it as a scratching post). We had been thinking of ways to repair it, then when Derek picked it up to move it, the whole thing came apart! It was an emergency trip down the pet shop and now Clipper has a new one, this time I have treated it with wood preserver. Not that we mind if the little chap out lives this run ;-). {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Our garden with Clippers new run, behind our bunnies home" class="size-full wp-image-6598" title="Our bunny run and guinea pig run in the garden" src="/wp-content/uploads/2001/09/post_DSCF0035.jpg" alt="Our garden with Clippers new run, behind our bunnies home" height="492" %}
