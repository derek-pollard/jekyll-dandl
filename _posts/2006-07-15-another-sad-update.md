More sad news for our little family. We had our naughty little Coral put to sleep. She had seemed to bounce back from the loss of her sister Clover, which she had taken quite badly. But she never managed to put back the weight she had lost. That coupled with her breathing problems started to get her down, she also had started to form quite a few tumours. Our vet was concerned that one of these was actually responsible for her breathing problems.

We all miss her, but no one more than Cookie. He took the loss of his sister very hard and at first didn't come out of his cage. If anyone tried to pick him up he would wiggle and squeak, he was not a happy boy. Fortunately he has settled down again now, though he still doesn't like being picked out of his cage, we have to wait for him to come out of his own accord. He is still a wobbly old boy, though he doesn't let it stop him getting about, he just takes more time in doing it. We have lowered all his beds and hammocks to make it easier for him to get to them and if he should have a fall, he is near the ground. Apart from being on his own, he seems happy and we are certainly giving him lots of attention and treats.
