As Inkie loved sleeping in an old cat box, we thought it would be fun to prepare one for Cubbie. We had a large version of the cat box Inkie used in the loft. We'd had it a long time and used it when we moved house with our previousÂ [two cats](http://www.derekandlindsay.co.uk/pets/cats/treacle-custard/). So, we dug it out of the loft and cleaned it up ready for our larger new arrival.

Obviously things have not gone according to plan and Inkie does not look impressed!
