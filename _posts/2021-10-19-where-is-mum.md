Lindsay passed away suddenly and everyone is heartbroken.

### Pip’s entry:

I’m confused as mum hasn’t been to see me for a while. I miss jumping on her legs for fuss, running around her and helping her clean out my home.

Dad has been giving me my medicine on his own, he’s doing really well though. It’s not so much fun being chased around without mum so I’m not as naughty as I used to be when dad needs to pick me up.

At feeding time mum always made sure I had a lovely selection of tasty bits to go with my normal food and she liked to arrange it just so. Mum fussed me in a special way, ruffling up the fur on my head, then dad would straighten it all out for me. I miss all that and I miss her.
