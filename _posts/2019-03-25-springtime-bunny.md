I'm very happy to report our rather bossy bunny is still going strong. Fern is making the most of the warm, dry Spring we are having. She is spending most of her days soaking up as much sunshine as possible, when she's not eating new shoots off her favourite plants.

We keep our garden quite natural, lots of fallen leaves and sticks for a bunny to snuggle down in, and Fern loves it. There are times she won't budge at all and we have to leave her loose in the garden while we go out. Its not something we like to do, but there is a reason we call Fern bossy. We love her very much and are thrilled that she is so strong and healthy.
