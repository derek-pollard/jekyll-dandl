<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6914" title="Our rat, Chockie drinking from a beaker of Ribena" src="/wp-content/uploads/2001/11/post_4168_IMG.jpg" alt="Our rat, Chockie drinking from a beaker of Ribena" width="390" height="327" />Little Chockie's tumour grew to a size where it was beginning to affect her life. Her back feet were straining to touch the floor, not that it stopped her climbing bars and getting into trouble. We had to make the very difficult decision to take her to the vets, before she began to suffer. Back in July when we first noticed Chockie's tumour it was very frightening, the vet warned us Chockie may only manage a couple of months as tumours grow so quickly.

Our brave little Chockie didn't give up, she insisted on doing everything her sister did, sometimes with a little help from us. As with all the little rats we have been lucky enough to know, Chockie was very special and she will leave a big hole in our lives. As always, Pipsie is a naughty little girl and we hope our love and cuddles will help her through the loss of her sister.
