Sadly we have lost little Rogue to a respiratory infection. She became very down, not wanting sunflower seeds and struggling to breath. We took her straight to the vets who gave her Baytril. As Rogue was very poorly we separated her from her sisters, we didn't want them to get ill and Rogue wasn't up to dealing with their fun and games. After a couple of days she seemed to pick up, her appetite returned and she even felt well enough to demolish a cardboard tube. Unfortunately the infection caught up with her and her little body couldn't cope and she died in my hands. We can take some comfort in the fact she wasn't alone and we knew she didn't suffer.

We are going to miss our cheekyÂ little girl very much. While Barley was very much the leader of our girls, Rogue was the trouble maker of the group. She loved looking for mischief to get into and to lead Barley astray. Her personality was much larger than her little gerbil body and her passing has left a very large hole in our family. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Cheeky Rogue sneaking up on Barely and Syrup" class="size-full wp-image-6493" title="Our little gerbil, Rogue harassing her sisters Barley and Syrup" src="/wp-content/uploads/2001/10/post_3932.jpg" alt="Cheeky Rogue sneaking up on Barely and Syrup" height="280" %}
