Ever since we moved into our house, about 4 years ago, the lawn has been in a sorry state. We've tried a few things to make it healthier and greener, but the moss was winning. Now Fern's living on it and we walk on it everyday, it has been getting worse.

So, we decided to treat Fern and ourselves and get some nice new grass. The lad we picked to do the work was very sweet. In fact his girlfriend works as a veterinary nurse at our vets, so not only was he sympathetic to our concerns about how the work would affect Fern, he also knew about our other critters. Some of the other people we had out for quotes weren't very good with Fern and some actually lent on her run to make notes, which she was not happy about. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="540" caption="Fern and her best friend Treacle" class="size-full wp-image-6307" title="Our bunny Fern and her feline friend Treacle enjoying their new lawn" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/post_4724.jpg" alt="Fern and her best friend Treacle" height="171" %} 

As Fern would never tolerate being kept in the house, not even for one day, we had to put her out in her run while the work was being carried out. We moved her run to a patio down the bottom of the garden, as far away from the work as possible, but still giving her a good view of what was going on and I'm pleased to say she was fine. Our garden is fairly small, so the work only took a day, which was really good as it meant Fern was hardly disrupted at all.

She was a little nervous of the new grass at first, she wasn't even sure about stepping on it, but that didn't last very long and then the fun started. It didn't take Fern long to realise we couldn't walk on the new grass, but she could. The little madam would sit out in the middle of the lawn when it was time to go back in her run and stare at us like we were daft, then when she'd had enough of the game she would kick her bottom in the air and hop into her run. She will be in for a shock in a few weeks when we can walk on the grass again. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Fern's old lawn on the left and her nice healthy new lawn on the right" class="size-full wp-image-6308" title="Our old lawn compared to our new freshly laid lawn" src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/post_newlawn.jpg" alt="Fern's old lawn on the left and her nice healthy new lawn on the right" height="353" %}
