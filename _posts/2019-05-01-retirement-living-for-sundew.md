Our sweet girl, Sundew has been slowing down over the past few months. She's still enjoying waddling around our home, but she's a bit slower and doesn't climb as much anymore. We'd also noticed she wasn't getting around her cage as well as before. At first we were reluctant to change her cage, because she is a rescue rat and can be quite sensitive we were worried the change would stress her. However we could no longer put it off, so we moved her into a retirement cage. These cages are not normally suitable for rats, but as they get older and climbing gets harder they are great to keep less mobile rats safe. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Sundew enjoying her new home" class="size-full wp-image-8864" title="Our old age rat, Sundew, in her new retirement cage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/post_6686.jpg" alt="Sundew enjoying her new home" height="698" %} 

I made sure to transfer all Sundew's favourite beds into her new home and I'm pleased to say Sundew took to the move very well. She actually seems happier now she doesn't have to climb. She's still coming out every morning and evening, just like she likes, but her time out of the cage, and her adventures, have decreased gradually.

It is a peaceful feeling watching our little girl wind down. Although we have only had her a relatively short time, just over a year and a half, Sundew was not a young rat when we got her. I am pretty sure she is well over two years old now, of not nearer three. When they get to such a good age, and have never suffered any illnesses, I find it very special to share their old age with them. Sundew has always been such a bossy and confident girl, taking to our family, and letting us know what she wanted so quickly it feels like I have known her since she was a baby. Don't get me wrong we are still hoping to share our home with Sundew for many months to come, but we are at peace with her old age status and caring for her in this new phase of her life is an adventure we are honoured to be able to share with her. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Slurp" class="size-full wp-image-8866" title="Our rat, Sundew drinking from a cat water bowl" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/post_0099.jpg" alt="Slurp" height="658" %}
