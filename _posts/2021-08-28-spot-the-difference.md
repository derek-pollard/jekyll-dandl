Rocket and Pebble are siblings, both born in May, but the size difference between them is huge. Pebble, while still a kitten, is starting to look like a little cat. Her features are very cat like and her fur is getting all sleek, even her tail is getting long and swishy. Little Rocket on the other hand still looks like a tiny kitten, a kitten with rather chunky legs! {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Pebble and her little brother, Rocket" class="size-full wp-image-9957" title="Out two kittens showing off their size difference" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/post_0939.jpg" alt="Pebble and her little brother, Rocket" height="568" %} 

We noticed the size difference when we saw them on the RSPCA website and in person when we first got to meet them. Nothing prepared us for living with him. Honestly every time we see him it is a surprise, he's so tiny. I'm also sure Pebble has grown a bit since we got her, but Rocket is still tiny. While in the care of the RSPCA they named them Melon (Pebble) and Lemon (Rocket), because of their size difference.

Sweet little Rocket doesn't know he's a mini cat and he gets up to far more mischief than his more reserved sister. Only time will tell if he'll catch up and goodness knows he has the appetite of a cat twice his size. Not that we mind either way, Rocket is ours and perfect whatever size he ends up.
