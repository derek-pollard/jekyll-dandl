We had a surprise visit from our neighbours rabbit today, she had tunnelled her way underneath the fence and when I spotted her, was chasing a very flustered looking Fern around the garden. Though there was no fighting going on, I could see Fern was not happy.

I'm sure it all looked rather comical, me trying to catch the rabbit and it alternating between chasing our two cats and Fern. It was not funny at the time though, as Fern was getting quite upset and both the cats had gone in the house, leaving Fern to face the brunt of the overexcitable droopy eared rabbit. After many laps of the garden, I think our visitor was getting hungry and I was able to tempt her into a pet carrierÂ with hay in it. I couldn't imagine Fern ever being so agreeable, but this bunny hopped right in. As our neighbours weren't in at the time, I had no choice but to shove the rabbit back under the fence the way it had come and after blocking off the hole, peace returned to the garden.
