After a supply run for rat food we went and fell in love with some teeny, tiny baby gerbils. We affectionally call the pet shop "Crunchie's Pet Shop" as it is where our first ever rat came from. We have to be careful shopping there just because they are so good with their animals and it is so tempting, as is proved by our new additions. We saw the baby gerbils two weeks before, they were sitting beside the counter in a large tank, they weren't for sale back then as they were too small, but when we popped in for more rat food the sign said they were ready to be homed.

There were six gerbils in the litter altogether, three boys and three girls. We went for the little girls and they are beautiful. Because they are bred in store the gerbils are all incredibly well socialised and love being picked up, though they are tricky to keep hold off :-) The store were also very sweet, they normally sell gerbils for £10 each, but the guy who bred them thought we'd love them so much he let us have them for £15 for all three. We'd have paid anything for them, but it is lovely that someone saw our love for little gerbils shining and wanted us to have them.

The girls are living in our previous gerbil, Wheatie's, old cage, but we have a surprise on the way for them. They are thrilled with their home and have started demolishing cardboard already. Olive and Plum are both grey agouti and Cherry is agouti. The girls have three very distinct personalties; Olive though tiny is very fearless and given a chance to leave the cage and run around she was off like a shot, taking no time at all to figure out how to get out of the cage. Cherry is the speedy one, she was a bit more nervous coming out, but when she does there is no stopping her as she charges about. Finally, Plum is very laid back, she likes to do things in her own sweet-time. Who knows how they will change as they grow, but I'm very excited to get to know them and earn their trust.
