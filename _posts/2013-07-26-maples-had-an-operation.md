Fortunately its not that big and we instantly made the decision to have it removed. It is a relief to say that Maple has coped with her surgery very well, and is not playing with her stitches.

Since it is just the two of them now, Maple and Dora have been spending all their time together and Dora was quite upset while Maple was away at the vets. Now she's home they are curled up together again and we are hopeful that the love of her sister will get Maple through this difficult time and help her make a full recovery.
