I'm very sad to say that our little cat Treacle passed away yesterday. A couple of weeks ago there was a drastic change in his behaviour, he didn't want to leave the house and also began sleeping in strange places.

Throughout the summer Treacle had been happily sleeping in the garden, popping in for his food. As the summer came to an end he began coming in earlier and sleeping in the house, which is normal for many cats. Then one day he came in and refused to go out again.

Our first real indication that something was seriously wrong was Treacle actually went to the toilet in our bunny Fawn's bowl of hay. This was completely out of character for Treacle, he has always been really good with all our bunnies and has never gone into their rooms before, never mind done something like this. I told Treacle off, but even then his reaction to me wasn't quite right.

The next day he started using the bath as a toilet, so we got his cat loo out from the loft and set it up for him and Treacle took to using it straight away. This was very unusual for Treacle too, he has always preferred to go to the toilet outside, even when it was really cold during winter he chose to go outside rather than use his cat toilet.

Treacle also took to sleeping in Fawn's room. We didn't stop him doing this, Fawn didn't mind, in fact I think our little bunny thought it was quite exciting. I don't know whether Fawn started pestering Treacle while he slept or he just wanted to move, but after a few days of sleeping in Fawn's room, Treacle began sleeping in the bath.

Derek and I also noticed that Treacle was not responding to us as normal, sometimes even looking at us like he had no idea who we were.

We took Treacle to the vets, who took a blood sample. From his symptoms the vet told us it was likely to be something serious, the question was whether his illness was treatable. Derek and I were devastated, and we had to wait several days for the results of his tests. During this time Treacle moved from sleeping in the bath to our shower cubical, while it was still wet! I had to keep picking him out and he would be sopping wet.

The results of Treacle's blood test confirmed our worst fears, Treacle had chronic kidney failure. While kidney failure is not treatable in cats, if caught soon enough it can be managed, with medication and a special diet. Sadly for our little cat he was too poorly for any kind of treatment and our vet recommended we have him put to sleep, which we did.

It is still very hard to accept he has gone. I can't say life with Treacle was perfect; he could be a little pest when he wanted, but he was our cat and we loved him very much. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Our beautiful boys" class="size-full wp-image-6587" title="Our two cats, Treacle and Custard snoozing on the sofa together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/post5200_IMG.jpg" alt="Our beautiful boys" height="421" %}
