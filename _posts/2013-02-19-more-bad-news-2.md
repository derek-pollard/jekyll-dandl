I'm really shocked and upset to say our little Mitzi has passed away. We not really sure what happened, it's all been such a terrible shock.

We'd started giving her baby food to help her, but she'd seemed a bit spaced out and not really interested. Breaking food up into little bits helped a bit, and she'd take baby food off our fingers. By Sunday she was very distracted, we were feeding her very runny baby food, which was hard going as she kept trying to wander off rather than eat. She had also started spending all her time in the igloo on the bottom of her cage, rather than up in her hanging beds with her sisters.

Then yesterday when we got up Mitzi was in a terrible state. She was barely able to stand up straight and kept rolling onto her back. Derek called the vets and we got an appointment for that afternoon, but as the day progressed poor Mitzi just got worse and after consulting with our vet we made the terrible decision to put her to sleep.

It was a difficult day, and I am left feeling very numb. Both Mitzi and her sister were very young, only one and a half, so loosing them has been a terrible shock. Unfortunately our gorgeous girl Dora is taking the loss of her sisters very hard, and is hiding away in the igloo. She seems to be eating well, so I can only hope that the company of Maple and Kiki and of course mine and Derek's attention will get her through this terrible time.

My two beautiful little princesses were so very special to me, and I had hoped to have many more happy months playing with them and spoiling them, but sadly that is not going to be. Right now I hope that little Dora will be alright and she can help keep the beautiful memory of her sisters alive. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="In happier times" class="size-full wp-image-10030" title="My three beautiful agouti rats huddled in their hammock" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/post_0762.jpg" alt="In happier times" height="463" %}
