I was cleaning my girls out and Blossom had a real bee in her bonnet about pinching a piece of kitchen towel. This is a new thing for Blossom, normally when I clean them out they are too busy playing elsewhere to notice what I'm up to. Today though Blossom needed that kitchen towel, and who was I to deny her!

After the girls cage was all clean and the girls were tucked up safety in bed I went on a hunt for the stolen kitchen towel and this is what I found. My cheeky girls had a right old stash going on.

During the week I often eat my lunch with the rats, and of course they want to share it with me. Lately I had noticed them begging for more than their fare share, but hey I love them and can't say no. Even if I do try and deny them my food they will just climb up me and help themselves anyway, which often ends in a right old mess :-). So, I have been spoiling the girls, I admit it, and obviously have been feeding them far too much!
