Since being apart Pip and Roo have both settled down really well, and their little degu personalities have really begun to shine. Whereas Max, our first degu, is quite bossy and screeches at us as his primary way of communication, Pip and Roo are much more melodic. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Pip enjoying some oats" class="size-full wp-image-7707" title="Our degu, Pip standing up and taking some oats from Derek's hand" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/post_0047.jpg" alt="Pip enjoying some oats" height="361" %} 

Firstly Pip, he is a warbler. He makes wonderful little squeaks and whistles, particularly when he is excited. Along with his binkying, he makes the sweetest noises. Compared to Roo and Max his volume is pretty low, but they are such happy noises you can't help but laugh which just gets him more excited. If we are feeding Pip oats he will make little whines, like he's begging, unlike Max who will squawk if you don't feed him fast enough.

Pip is the only one of our degus who loves a flying saucer wheel. The plastic wheel was originally Max's but he never used it, so when Pip and Roo came along they had it. Again Roo wasn't interested, but Pip loved it. Now everyone has a fancy metal wheel, and Pip loves his, but he still uses his flying saucer on a daily basis. Pip's favourite game in his big metal wheel is to run really, really fast and then jump out, wait a few seconds and then jump back in the wheel while its still spinning.

As he has got older, Pip has also turned into a little fuss pot. It just started one day, no long ago. He would let Derek tickle his cheek while he was eating oats, but that was it once he'd finished eating he was off, but gradually it increased. Now he expects a good chin tickle and tummy rub every time he is out. We rather enjoy it too. {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Roo enjoying a well earned rest" class="size-full wp-image-7709" title="Our degu, Roo, snuggled in his fleecy bed" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/post_3632.jpg" alt="Roo enjoying a well earned rest" height="338" %} 

Compared to Pip and Max, Roo is rather bonkers. While Max and Pip are more vocal when the are out, Roo sings his heart out in his cage. From running in his wheel, to eating and even pooping (which all degus love to do) Roo has a song for everything! He is a wonderfully happy little guy, which is amazing compared to how he behaved when he lived with Pip. Roo lives in the smallest cage out of our degus, and while we planned to get him a larger home, he really seems to love where he is. He is very good at letting us know what he wants, especially when he's ready to go back in his home. It doesn't matter if Roo can get to his cage by himself or not, he loves us to put him in.

Roo was the first of our degus to get a metal wheel, after he broke his plastic one, and he loves it. As is fitting with Roo's personality he has the craziest running styles, sometimes he almost runs sideways in the wheel, kind of galumphing along sideways, other times he's jumping up the side and letting the wheels momentum carry him. He can run normally too when the mood takes him. It's quite a sight to see, especially if he's singing at the same time.

Compared to Pip, Roo is now the bigger of the two. He's a very stocky chap, out of everyone Roo spends most time playing in his wheel, while out playing he will often pop back in to play on his wheel. Though unlike Pip or Max he doesn't like fuss, or any kind of contact. He will jump onto the palm of our hands to be put back in his cage, or sit on our knees to get oats, but we can't touch him at all.

We are pretty sure all three degus are happy, they love to come out and play at least four times a day for as long as they like, they don't overeat and they are very good natured guys, well with the exception of the odd chomp at the furniture. It is a wonderful learning experience getting to know them, and while they are not my rats I love them all very much.
