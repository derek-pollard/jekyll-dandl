Derek and I love a night together playing video games. I've got terrible eye sight and so I need to sit closer to the television to play certain games. Rather than move an armchair across the room every time, Derek bought me a bean bag. A jumbo slouch bag to be precise!<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/change_thumbjpg.jpg" alt="change_thumbjpg" title="change_thumbjpg" width="1" height="1" class="alignright size-full wp-image-9953" />

We have two cats and what do cats love? Bean bags of course.

Eleven years ago I had a not so fancy bean bag and nothing has changed. As soon as my new bean bag arrived it had to be Inkie's. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="940" caption="Inkie in my old bean bag (2010) and my luxury new one (2021)" class="size-full wp-image-9872" title="Our little cat Inkie enjoying bean bag life" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Inkie-bean-bag.jpg" alt="Inkie in my old bean bag (2010) and my luxury new one (2021)" height="353" %}
