It seemed so far away when we first adopted Rocket and Pebble but before we knew it, it was time for them to be neutered and spayed. Not that you would know looking at the size of the sweet little pair. 

To make sure there would be availability for their operations we booked their vets appointments a couple of weeks ahead. We figured that we knew when they were due and it would stop us getting nervous and tempted to put it off closer to the time - not that we would as it's very important especially with them being mixed sexes. 

When it came time we had some concern that Rocket was actually mature enough for his operation, but happily he was approved for the procedure. 

Thankfully everything went well and to routine. Our two brave little kittens came back sleepy but in good spirits. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Sleepy Rocket and Pebble having a post-op cuddle" class="size-full wp-image-10328" title="Rocket and Pebble having a post-op cuddle" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/post_1518.jpg" alt="Rocket and Pebble having a post-op cuddle" height="563" %} 

Rather than have an undignified collar, which was giving her trouble drinking, we wanted Pebble to have a jump suit as they worked so well for Inkie and especially Jessie. There was some confusion as the one the vets supplied was too large as they didn't try fitting it first! We had to go and get another one in a rush before Pebble messed about with her surgery wound. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Pebble in her jump suit" class="size-full wp-image-10329" title="Pebble in her jump suit" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/post_1521.jpg" alt="Pebble in her jump suit" height="631" %}
