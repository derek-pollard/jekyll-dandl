The RSPCA called us just over a week ago about a "problem rat" they had who needed an experienced owner - we had to go and meet him. We have adopted rats from them before and they explained they wanted some advice from an experienced rat owner.

Twix had been found abandoned, back in August, in a small hamster cage that hadn't been cleaned out for a very long time. By the time the RSPCA called us Twix was looking a lot cleaner and happier, but he had bitten one of the RSPCA staff quite badly and they were concerned if he was suitable for rehoming.

Twix is a large agouti hooded male rat and he is absolutely gorgeous. At the time we weren't sure what to do. Taking on any rat is a big responsibility, especially one with a history like Twix. It took one look at Twix and we were smitten, he looked so sad and lonely sitting in the corner of his cage, with his eyes half closed. There were a pair of what looked like heavy duty welding gloves beside his cage, which was a little unnerving, but there was something about Twix and so he joined our family.

Twix is a very stressed and frightened rat and we are going to take things slowly with him. While he doesn't like being handled, and he gets a bit tense if you try and touch him too much, he doesn't mind being wrapped in a hand towel and picked up. This is very handy for getting him back in his cage. Hopefully given time and patience he will settle down and we'll get to see Twix's real personality.
