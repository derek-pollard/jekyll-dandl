We had our little cat spayed on Tuesday 2nd November. As expected the operation was simple and we collected Inkie at 4pm from the vet the same day. She was all cute and woozy and wearing one of those plastic cone collars to stop her licking her stitches.

At home, she was straight out of her cat box and staggering around the house, banging her plastic collar into everything. Poor Cubbie – who had himself been sulking all day at Inkie's absence – didn’t know what to make of her and stayed well out of her way. Inkie didn't care, she was too busy careering around the house and catching her collar on everything.

All was fine for two hours until Inkie decided she did not like her collar and it was coming off. There was a bit of a scuffle as she got it stuck in her mouth and Derek and I got scratched when we tried to help her. Then she managed to catch her claw in the strip of bandage that was tied round her neck to keep it on and undid the knot!

There was no way Derek and I were getting that collar back on, Inkie was all claws and uncooperative. So we nipped back round to our vets - who are thankfully only a quick walk round the corner - and got her fitted with a lovely red pet surgical t-shirt.

Back home Inkie seemed much happier, still very wobbly, but she wasn't attacking the t-shirt and it didn't hinder her getting around. Derek and I went to bed feeling very happy that the worst - Inkie's operation – was over and Inkie could get on with recovering. Inkie had other ideas {% include captionedimage.html align="alignright" width="390" caption="Kitty play time" class="size-full wp-image-6037" title="Our cats, Inkie and Cubbie playing together" src="/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/post_1991.jpg" alt="Kitty play time" height="337" %} 

The next morning Inkie made it quite clear she was not happy. I won't go into all the unpleasent details, other than to say that during the week she had to wear the suit Inkie refused to use a litter tray, sat around sulking, and wouldn't let us cuddle her. She also put on a performance each time she moved, shaking her legs, like there was something wrong with them and behaving as though she had no sense of balance. We actually began to worry about her until we took the suit off and she immediately returned to normal, then when the suit went back on the sulky behaviour returned.

This continued until Wednesday when we booked her in to have her stitches removed and the suit came off. Her stitches were actually due to be removed on the Friday, but we could not take anymore of our naughty cat and fortunately the vet agreed her stitches were okay to come out early.

I'm pleased to say the transformation in Inkie, once her suit was taken off, was instant. She is still being a bit naughty about using her litter trays, but that is our Inkie and part of that comes from the upset of being rejected by her first family. We are just happy she is back to playing, chasing Cubbbie around the house and enjoying lots of cuddles.
