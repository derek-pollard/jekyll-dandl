Terrorizing the cats.

We have two cats, [Treacle & Custard](/cats/treacle-custard/ "Treacle & Custard"), and when not digging in her tunnel, or taking a break in the shade, Fern is harassing our cats.

The poor things are ten now, which is fairly old for a cat and they just want to laze around in the sunshine and be left in peace. Fern is far too young and curious to respect this wish and so our poor cats have to put up with being harassed by an over friendly bunny.<!--more-->

Fern doesn't seem to understand, or care, that the cats could really hurt her if they wanted to. She often runs up behind them and startles the poor old things, then when they run off she chases them like its a game.

Treacle & Custard are both used to rabbits and with their age I don't think they can be bothered to hurt Fern, but I do wish she wouldn't harass them quite so much
