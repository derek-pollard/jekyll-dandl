Both Bramble and Lime are suffering from wheezy breathing. We have no idea what is wrong with them. Their sister, Apricot, started with the same symptoms as them two weeks before, and she seems to be coming though it now. We are hoping that both boys will do the same. They have been on Baytril, but it had no effect. It is quite scary as our boy and girl rats both live in separate rooms and we are very careful about hygene when it comes to our rats. {% include captionedimage.html align="aligncenter" width="780" caption="Bramble, Lime and Apple" class="size-full wp-image-8980" title="Struggling to hold my three boy rats" src="/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/post_2230.jpg" alt="Bramble, Lime and Apple" height="468" %} 

We have two more boy rats who live upstairs who are both fine and we wonder if the illness is something the little ones picked up at the rehoming centre.

Bramble and Lime are both pretty down at the moment, which is very difficult. Not just because we don't like to see our rats unhappy, but also because Apple has no one to play with. Derek and I are trying very hard to be there for him, and play with him, but we can tell he misses his brothers.

All we can do is hope that they will get better soon.
